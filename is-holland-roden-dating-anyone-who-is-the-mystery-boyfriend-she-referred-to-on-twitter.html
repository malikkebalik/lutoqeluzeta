When the supernatural teen drama&nbsp;series&nbsp;was at its peak, Roden's fans <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">flooded</a>&nbsp;social media with speculations—some quite baseless, whereas some with receipts. However, the actress always responded to them with grace and humor. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>To stir the speculations, Roden has mentioned—on several occasions—about her boyfriend in different humorous tweets. This has turned the fans into investigators trying to solve the dating mystery. But how much truth do the actress'&nbsp;tweets have? Let's find out!</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Fans Speculated That&nbsp;Holland Roden Was Dating One Of Her Co-stars</h2><p>Teen Wolf fans' legions have always been vocally curious about the red-headed actress Roden's personal life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The fans stormed Twitter to inquire if she was dating one of her co-stars, Max Carver. A fan going by the handle @PrObLeM_WoLf was one of the many fans to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">do so</a>. She straight away went ahead and asked Carver and Roden if they were dating. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Another fan <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">expressed</a> similar curiosity about the actors' status, with added drama.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@maxcarver</a> MaxðŸ˜Š 1 question, you and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@hollandroden</a> are dating, or only are best friends? PLEASE ANSWER OR IM GOING TO CRY AND DIE ðŸ˜±<br>thanksðŸ¤—ðŸ’• — ara (@dalittlebanshee) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">February 23, 2016</a></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>We don't really blame them for their constant curiosity as, according to various <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a>,&nbsp;the co-stars were actually dating! <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Apparently, the pair, who met at the sets of Teen Wolf,&nbsp;started&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dating</a> each other back in 2014. They also began sharing pictures on their&nbsp;Instagram accounts, which left many of their fans wondering&nbsp;about their relationship off the camera. However, they kept their relationship super low-key, and neither of them admitted dating each other. And eventually, they broke up in 2016. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Another Co-star, Another Dating Rumor!</h2><p>Roden wasn't on the receiving end of dating queries regarding just one co-star. Her followers were constantly questioning her regarding her relationship with another actor, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Colton Hayes</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>These repeated questions are a testament to Holland's popularity and the fans’ interest in her and her co-stars’ personal lives. But, thanks to Hayes being&nbsp;very vocal about his and Roden's friendship, we can say that these two were really good friends. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Hayes has, in a few instances, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> his appreciation towards their friendship. He has even shared a tweet stating how he loved babysitting with Roden.</p><p>It is quite transparent that they shared a very special relationship and loved spending quality time with each other. However, neither of them has explicitly confirmed or denied if they were more than friends.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Holland Roden Has Not Confirmed Any Speculation Regarding Her Relationship Status But Has Mentioned A 'Boyfriend'</h2><p>By now, it is quite clear that the actress is very private when it comes to sharing deets regarding her dating life. However, she has mentioned her boyfriend several times, either jokingly or indirectly, in many of her tweets. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In an interaction with her fans back in&nbsp;2014, she had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mentioned</a> celebrating April Fool's day with her boyfriend.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On another occasion, the Teen Wolf star mentioned&nbsp;her boyfriend again, sharing that she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">liked</a> bland eggs and that her boyfriend would attest to that.&nbsp;Although this was clearly a joke, this again is the kind of coy reference that sends her fans crazy.</p><p>Besides the mention of a 'boyfriend', the Teen Wolf actress&nbsp;has also jokingly referred to journalist&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Steve Kornacki</a> as her match in her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a> posts for his quirky, humorous TV presence. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Although the&nbsp;mystery around her boyfriend has not been revealed, the Taco-loving actress is surely enjoying her life. Perhaps someday, her fans will finally get to know about her relationship status and will be happier for it.&nbsp;Until then, all we can do is appreciate this absolute gem of an actress and her funny social media banters.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>&nbsp;</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnmKS5ra3NnWSrp5Sau26wwK2gp59dl7y6stGinKecXp3Brrg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jonathan-knight-net-worth-kahawatungu.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jonathan Knight Net Worth - KahawaTungu</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-hallie-jackson-married-hallie-jackson-husband-age-networth-biography-instagram-and-twitter.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Hallie Jackson Married?
