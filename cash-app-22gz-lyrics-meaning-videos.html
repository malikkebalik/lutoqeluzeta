The recurring theme of the song is the use of the Cash App, a mobile payment application, to pay for hits to be carried out against those who oppose him. Throughout the song, 22Gz describes his arsenal of weapons, including guns tucked into his clothing, and boasts of his ability to turn his enemies into hashtags with hollow tip bullets.</p><br><p>The first verse of the song finds 22Gz riding around with his gang, the Blixky, searching for enemies to take out. He is depicted as a dangerous figure who is ready to kill at a moment's notice, with a gun in his backpack and another tucked into his pants. He pays his hitmen through the Cash App, reflecting the increasing propensity of criminals to use mobile payments to carry out their activities.</p><br><p>In the second verse, 22Gz continues to describe his violent tendencies, rhyming about his assassins and the various guns they use to kill. He also makes it clear that he is uninterested in talking or negotiation, as "semi gon' split that." The refrain of the song repeats the image of "spinnin' with blixkys and black flags," emphasizing the gang's readiness to cause chaos and violence.</p><br><p>Overall, "Cash App" paints a bleak picture of life on the streets of Brooklyn, where violence and murder are everyday occurrences. The lyrics reveal a world far removed from the mainstream, where criminal organizations operate with complete immunity from the law.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line
