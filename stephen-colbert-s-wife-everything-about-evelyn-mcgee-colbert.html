On September 11, 1974, he lost his father and two brothers in a plane crash that killed 72 out of the 82 people on board.</p><p class=dh>He revealed that he did not fully grieve the loss of his father and brothers until he got into college. He was in bad shape, got very sad about it, and even lost 50 pounds that year.</p><p class=dh>He went on to study acting and has revealed that he also studied voice and ballet. In 1995, Stephen co-created a sketch comedy show for Comedy Central. The show lasted for two years, and once it ended, he became a correspondent on "The Daily Show."</p><p class=dh>When he started his show "The Colbert Report" in 2005, he had become the longest-running and most diverse correspondent on "The Daily Show," and in 2015, he became the host of "The Late Show."</p><p class=dh>When Stephen initially started "The Late Show," he tried to handle everything by himself rather than have a showrunner, negatively impacting his on-air performance. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.nickiswift.com/66664/untold-truth-stephen-colbert/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"It was like going from go-kart to NASCAR in terms of the speed at which everything had to happen."</p><p class=dh>While he was a micromanager, a former colleague was also concerned that he was doing too much. In addition, Stephen needed to improve his interviewing skills, which he admitted were somewhat lacking because he was used to portraying a character on "The Colbert Report."</p><p class=dh>He initially thought he would transition from playing a character to interviewing guests with ease, but Stephen realized that not everyone would be willing to share themselves, and he had to deal with it.</p><p class=dh>The network soon hired a showrunner to take responsibility for the mechanics of producing the show, leaving <a class="me a" href=#>Stephen Colbert</a> free to think creatively. He soon found his voice, relaxed, and improved his interviewing. A show insider said he became a better listener and a new guy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwam9gbHqmwsSlsKdlnZi0prGMnKalmpWnwW6x1Z6psqyYnruoedaopJqmXay1b7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./clarababylegs-youtuber-wiki-bio-age-height-weight-measurements-dating-affair-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>ClaraBabyLegs (Youtuber) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Measurements, Dating, Affair, Net Worth,</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ryan-ross-married-net-worth-new-song-bio.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ryan Ross Married, Net Worth, New Song, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./raising-the-staal-brothers-hard-work-humility-and-family.html>Raising the Staal Brothers: Hard work, humility and family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./about-davido-his-kids-age-family-and-parents.html>About Davido, His Kids, Age, Family and Parents</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aurora-teagarden-mysteries-order-watch-movie-chronologically-by-release-date.html>Aurora Teagarden Mysteries Order, Watch Movie Chronologically, by Release Date</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kimberly-woodruff.html>Kimberly Woodruff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nyjer-morgan-net-worth-pulptastic.html>Nyjer Morgan Net Worth - Pulptastic</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnogBlogy.
