While she has always been open about all the cosmetic treatments, she also claims to have no regrets.</strong></p><p><strong>Charlotte Crosby</strong> is an English <a href=#><strong>television personality</strong></a> best known for her roles in the MTV reality series, Geordie Shore, and as the winner of Celebrity Big Brother's twelfth series. She began presenting Just Tattoo of Us in 2017. Later, she debuted her own reality show, The Charlotte Show, in 2018.</p><p>However, with all the gain in popularity, she has also gained a lot of criticism in her career due to her unnatural appearance. Fans have been accusing her of having a drastic change in appearance as the result of multiple plastic surgery procedures. So, if you're curious to find out which procedure the singer has undergone, we got you covered.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>plastic surgery</a></strong>&nbsp;stories of <a href=#><strong>Nikki Exotika</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Omid Scobie</strong></a>.</p><h2>Charlotte Crosby Openly Admits to Undergoing Plastic Surgery Like Rhinoplasty, Lip Filler & Breast Augmentation Surgery!</h2><p>Over the years, <strong>Charlotte Crosby</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@charlottegshore</a>) hasn't been ashamed of the plastic surgery procedures she has undergone on her face and body and believes that anyone who has a problem with their face or body should not be ashamed of going under the knife to fix it. She previously stated,</p><p><strong>You shouldn't get anything stupid done to yourself when you don't need it, but if you have got something that makes you lack in confidence massively, go and bloody change it! You have got one life, don't live it in misery and unhappiness.</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/11/charlotte-crosby-after-plastic-surgery.jpg alt="Charlotte Crosby before and after plastic surgery. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Charlotte Crosby before and after plastic surgery.<br>Image Source: The Sun<br></strong></p><p>Talking about her plastic surgery procedures, she received <strong>rhinoplasty</strong> surgery in 2014 to change the shape of her nose and even admitted that seeing herself on TV convinced her to have the procedure. Later, in an interview with Heat magazine, she said, "My old nose was awful, it was so bad. I do think [my nose] caused a lack of confidence, and you always compare yourself to other people who are on TV as well." She continued,</p><p><strong>When I watched myself before and I turned to the side I felt sick because my nose looked so awful. No-one ever noticed my nose, I never got one comment in my whole entire life saying you've got a bad nose. But I wasn't happy with it, I got it done for me.</strong></p><p>Likely, Charlotte Crosby <a href=# rel=noopener>admitted</a> that if she had never appeared on television, she would not have been tempted to have surgery. She explained. "It's not like I can hide it [her nose]. If I'd not been on TV, I'd never have got it done. I do know what people mean about surgery being a slippery slope," she said of rumors about patients becoming addicted to surgery. She then added,</p><p><strong>You just think, 'I hate it', especially on television. I think it'll make a big difference to my life in terms of getting photographed and always being on the telly, not having to worry about where to stand or what angle to go from.</strong></p><p>And if you're not aware, her lips have also grown significantly larger over the years. However, she has previously revealed that she gets her <strong>lip filler</strong> topped up every 12 months. She admitted, "I get them done once a year. I had a big problem down the sides, but once a year that's it and I don't think they're that bad."</p><p>Furthermore, Charlotte Crosby has a condition known as congenital symmastia, which manifests as a webbing across her breasts. She claimed she had been self-conscious about her condition for years, so she decided to have a <strong>breast augmentation</strong> to correct the problem. In 2017, she admitted to having surgery as a result of online criticism, saying,</p><p><strong>Because I'm famous, if a picture of me is online, people say things like 'What is wrong with her boobs? They're deformed! They're stuck together. My uni-boob made me feel under-confident. It [the condition congenital symmastia] really limited what I could wear without people saying, 'What the f---'s wrong with her boobs?'</strong></p><p>However, Charlotte said she has no regrets about any of her procedures and that she now feels much more confident in her skin. She told the Daily Mail, "I have no regrets about having surgery. I have no regrets over my surgery. I never went over the top. I'm very happy and feel a lot more confident now that I've had the [breast procedure]."</p><h2>Charlotte Crosby Bursts Into Tears as She Admits She Wants More Children After Her Daughter, Alba, Made Her Feel Reborn!</h2><p><strong>Charlotte Crosby</strong> broke down in tears during a live appearance on This Morning on November 28 when she revealed she wants more babies.

The TV personality acknowledged that she is prepared to postpone their wedding day for a while, saying,</p><p><strong>I want more babies, that is my priority. I love being a mum it's the best thing that's ever happened to us because it has just changed my life. She had made us feel like I am born again. Maybe in 2026 or 2027. I want five kids first!
