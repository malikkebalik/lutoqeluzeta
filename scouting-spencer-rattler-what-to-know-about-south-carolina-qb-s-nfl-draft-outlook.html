With a strong close to his redshirt junior season (his first at <a class=ath_autolink href=#>South Carolina</a>), has he reestablished himself as a premier talent? We‚Äôll be tracking Rattler‚Äôs performance from now through April here on our draft hub. Consider it a rolling scouting report on his play (and his draft stock).</p><h2>2022 season updates</h2><p><strong>Nov. 26 (South Carolina 31, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Clemson</a> 30)</strong></p><p>What a way for the Gamecocks to close their year. A week after upsetting <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tennessee</a>, South Carolina snapped Clemson‚Äôs 40-game home win streak. Rattler wasn‚Äôt as flawless as he‚Äôd been against the Vols ‚Äî he fired an early pick six right into <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jeremiah Trotter Jr.</a>‚Äôs arms ‚Äî but he still finished 25-of-39 for 360 yards and three total TDs (two passing, one rushing).</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Meanwhile, Spencer Rattler has six completions of 20+ on Clemson today. ESPN says it's the most vs. Clemson defense since at least 2011.</p><p>‚Äî Stewart Mandel (@slmandel) <a href=#>November 26, 2022</a></p><p><strong>Nov. 19 (South Carolina 63, Tennessee 38)</strong></p><p>The Rattler once talked up as a potential first-round pick showed up in a big way during the Gamecocks‚Äô blowout win. From&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>The Athletic‚Äôs Aaron Suttles</a>: ‚ÄúIn total, Rattler completed 30-of-37 passes for 438 yards and six touchdowns in the 63-38 win against the Vols. It‚Äôs the fourth-most passing yards in a game by a South Carolina quarterback, and the six touchdown passes set a program record.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>If that wasn‚Äôt enough, Rattler rushed for 16 yards and caught a 15-yard pass to set up a touchdown that put the Gamecocks ahead 28-14 in the second quarter.‚Äù</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>SPENCER RATTLER üêçüöÄ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/SuFNfKMsXP</a></p><p>‚Äî SEC Network (@SECNetwork) <a href=#>November 20, 2022</a></p><h2>What you need to know</h2><p>A five-star recruit and one of the prizes of the 2019 recruiting cycle, Rattler chose <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Oklahoma</a> and head coach Lincoln Riley‚Äôs high-flying offensive attack. After redshirting (but playing sparingly in three games) as a freshman, Rattler won the Sooners QB job in 2020, then threw for 290 yards and four TDs in his first start, against Missouri State. He and the Sooners quickly crashed back to earth, losing their next two games to <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Kansas State</a> and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Iowa State</a>, before rebounding to win eight straight. Included in that run were victories in the Big 12 championship (over <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Iowa</a> State) and Cotton Bowl (over <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Florida</a>). Rattler finished the year with 3,031 yards, 28 touchdowns and seven interceptions.</p><p>It wasn‚Äôt enough to hold his starting job through 2021, though. In the Sooners‚Äô sixth game, a dramatic 55-48 win over <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Texas</a>, Riley benched Rattler in favor of <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Caleb Williams</a>. That order stuck: Williams as QB1, Rattler as QB2. Then, in late November, Riley departed to take the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>USC</a> job, and Williams later followed him to the West Coast. Rattler, meanwhile, transferred to South Carolina. There, he reunited with Shane Beamer, formerly Oklahoma‚Äôs assistant head coach (2018-20).</p><h2>Preseason scouting report</h2><p>Rattler, ranked <a href=# rel=noopener>No. 7 on Dane Brugler‚Äôs list</a> of the top draft-eligible underclassman,&nbsp;is getting a fresh start in Columbia after his time in Oklahoma. While he did show flashes of top-tier arm talent that led to his high ranking as a recruit, his play and decision-making were frustratingly inconsistent, leading to Rattler losing the starting job midseason to Williams (who‚Äôs now at USC) and his subsequent transfer.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>If Rattler displays more polish in his play and chops down on his mistakes while playing in the SEC, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>NFL</a> teams will be more than willing to bet on the ‚Äúwow‚Äù throws that have cropped up in his career. But if he continues his sporadic play outside the confines of a Lincoln Riley offense to prop him up, then that gamble becomes far less appetizing for NFL front offices to make. ‚Äî&nbsp;Nate Tice</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Gamecocks welcome Spencer Rattler ‚Ä¶ and their moment in the spotlight</p></a><p>(Photo: Jeff Blake / USA Today)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57knJocXBiZnxzfJFrZmppX2eDcL%2FPnqWcnaJiv6LA06Wcq2Wem7lusNGana1lYmV%2FdHnSnKaurJmjtHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-marie-carlson-nbc-dateline-to-revisit-fort-walton-beach-woman-s-murder-the-talks-t.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What happened to Marie Carlson?
