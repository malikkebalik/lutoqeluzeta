This absence has left many people wondering why one of their favorite superstars has taken a break. In this article, we’ll dive into the reasons behind Roman Reigns’ absence in simple, human-friendly language.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Why-Is-Roman-Reign-Absent-min-1024x580.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Roman_Reigns></span><strong>Who Is Roman Reigns?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/nr8gwvkW_400x400.jpg><p>Roman Reigns is a professional wrestler and former American football player. He is widely known for his tenure in WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment), where he performs under the ring name Roman Reigns. Born as Leati Joseph Anoa’i on May 25, 1985, in Pensacola, Florida, Roman Reigns comes from a prestigious wrestling family known as the Anoa’i family, which includes several other accomplished wrestlers such as his father Sika Anoa’i, his uncle Afa Anoa’i, and his cousins, The Usos and the late Yokozuna.</p><p>Roman Reigns initially pursued a career in football before transitioning to professional wrestling. He played college football for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets and later signed with the NFL’s Minnesota Vikings in 2007. However, he was released by the Vikings in 2008. He then briefly played for the Edmonton Eskimos in the Canadian Football League (CFL) before joining the Jacksonville Jaguars. Unfortunately, he was released by the Jaguars before the start of the 2010 NFL season.</p><p>In 2010, Roman Reigns embarked on his professional wrestling career by signing with WWE. He began in WWE’s developmental territory, Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), where he wrestled under the ring name Leakee. His talent quickly gained recognition, and in 2012, he was promoted to WWE’s main roster.</p><p>Roman Reigns gained immense popularity as a member of the wrestling stable known as “The Shield,” alongside Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose. The group became one of the most iconic and beloved factions in WWE history, winning the WWE Tag Team Championship multiple times.</p><p>In 2014, Roman Reigns embarked on a successful singles career, winning the WWE World Heavyweight Championship multiple times. He has since become one of the top stars in WWE, known for his charisma, athleticism, and in-ring skills.</p><p>Beyond his wrestling career, Roman Reigns is recognized for his inspirational journey, particularly his battle with leukemia, which he announced publicly in 2018. After successfully overcoming leukemia, he returned to WWE and continues to be a dominant force in the world of professional wrestling.</p><p>Roman Reigns’ character is often referred to as “The Tribal Chief” and “The Head of the Table,” emphasizing his leadership role in the wrestling faction known as “The Bloodline.” His performances and storylines have made him a central figure in WWE’s programming, and he remains one of the most prominent and influential wrestlers in the industry today.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_Is_Roman_Reign_Absent-2></span><strong>Why Is Roman Reign Absent?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Roman_Reigns_Tribute_to_the_Troops_2016-877x1024.jpg><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Health Battles and Triumphs</strong></h4><p>One of the biggest reasons for Roman Reigns’ absence from the WWE is his health. In October 2018, he stunned the wrestling world by revealing that he had leukemia, a type of blood cancer. This news hit fans and fellow wrestlers hard. Roman had to put his wrestling career on hold to focus on his health.</p><p>During his battle with leukemia, Roman Reigns showed incredible strength and resilience. He underwent months of treatment and faced this tough situation head-on. Thankfully, in February 2019, he had some fantastic news to share – he was in remission and ready to return to the wrestling ring.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2023/03/141d9-16790415485423-1920.jpg><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Pandemic Plays a Part</strong></h4><p>Just when everyone was looking forward to Roman Reigns’ comeback, another challenge arose. It was the COVID-19 pandemic that shook the world. Roman Reigns, who had already been through a lot with his leukemia diagnosis, had a weakened immune system. This meant that he was at a higher risk if he contracted the virus.</p><p>To protect himself and his family, Roman made a difficult decision. In March 2020, he chose to step away from WWE once again. This decision was not easy, but it was the right one. Health should always come first, and Roman knew that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1-1.webp><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Family Matters</strong></h4><p>Another important factor in Roman Reigns’ decision to take a break from wrestling is his family. Being a professional wrestler is not just physically demanding; it also requires a lot of time away from home. Roman has two young children, and being a loving father and husband is a top priority for him.</p><p>In an interview with Sports Illustrated in May 2020, Roman Reigns made it clear that his family’s well-being was more important than anything else at that point in his life. He talked about how grateful he was for the extra time he got to spend with his wife and kids during his hiatus from WWE.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wwe-roman-reigns-titles-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_WWE_Did_to_Keep_Wrestlers_Safe></span><strong>What WWE Did to Keep Wrestlers Safe</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>WWE took the health and safety of its wrestlers seriously during the pandemic. They implemented strict testing protocols, limited audience attendance, and enforced social distancing measures. These steps were taken to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading among the wrestlers and staff.</p><p>Despite all these precautions, Roman Reigns decided to stay away to minimize any potential risks to his health. It was a tough call, but it showed his commitment to staying safe and healthy for his family and fans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Roman_Reigns_23-635x1024.webp><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Responsible_Decision></span><strong>A Responsible Decision</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the end, Roman Reigns’ absence from WWE is a result of his responsible approach to life. He faced a life-threatening illness, battled it with courage, and emerged victorious. Then, when faced with a global pandemic, he prioritized his health and his family.</p><p>As fans eagerly await Roman Reigns’ return to the WWE, it’s important to remember that even our favorite wrestling superstars have challenges and responsibilities beyond the ring. Roman Reigns’ story is a reminder that health should always be a top priority, no matter who you are or what you do.</p><p>In the world of professional wrestling, Roman Reigns is not just a superstar; he’s a role model. His absence is a testament to his dedication to staying safe and healthy, and it’s a decision that deserves our respect and understanding. So, let’s all wish Roman Reigns well and look forward to the day he makes his triumphant return to the WWE.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=FAQ></span><strong>FAQ</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3 class=rank-math-question><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_ended_the_Romans_reign></span><strong>Who ended the Romans reign?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Roman Reigns’ reign as WWE Universal Champion was ended by Brock Lesnar.</p><h3 class=rank-math-question><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_old_is_Roman_reign_now></span><strong>How old is Roman reign now?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Roman Reigns was born on May 25, 1985, which makes him [38] years old.</p><h3 class=rank-math-question><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_much_do_Roman_Reigns_get_paid></span><strong>How much do Roman Reigns get paid?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Per Essentially Sports, Reigns has a salary of&nbsp;$5 million annually&nbsp;with WWE.
