Cooley, who had been with Providence for 10 seasons, led the Friars to five NCAA Tournament appearances and a Big East Championship during his tenure. The move to Georgetown represents a new challenge for Cooley and an opportunity for him to take his coaching career to the next level.</p><p>The decision to leave Providence was not an easy one for Cooley, as he had built a strong program at the school and had a deep connection with the community. However, the opportunity to coach at a prestigious program like Georgetown was too good to pass up. Cooley is widely regarded as one of the best coaches in the Big East, and he brings a wealth of experience and knowledge to the Hoyas.</p><p>Cooley’s departure from Providence leaves a significant void in the Friars’ program. The school will need to find a new coach who can build on the foundation that Cooley has laid and continue to push the program forward. The Friars have a strong basketball tradition and a passionate fan base, and the school will no doubt be looking for a coach who can build on that legacy.</p><h2 id=is-ed-cooley-leaving-providence class="rb-heading-index-2 wp-block-heading">Is Ed Cooley Leaving Providence?</h2><p>Yes, Ed Cooley has left Providence to take the head coaching position at Georgetown University.
