She&nbsp;has been in the entertainment industry since&nbsp;her teenage days. It is fair to say&nbsp;she has aged in her years under&nbsp;the spotlight, which does have an influence over one's appearance.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, netizens over on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">forums like Quora</a> don't believe that all of the changes in appearances could&nbsp;be attributed to age alone.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>One argument that seemed&nbsp;to be unanimous was that the rapper had several nose jobs done — not just one. They argued&nbsp;the songstress had&nbsp;rhinoplasties&nbsp;done to slim down her nose bridge, make the nostrils slimmer, and make the tip of her nose less bulbous.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>They put forth that all of these modifications were not conducted in one fell swoop, but rather with a series of procedures over time. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They also presented Manoban's pre-debut photos and contrasted them against her current ones to highlight said claims.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Several Procedures Around the Eyes</h2><p>Netizens further speculated that Manoban has had epicanthoplasty, blepharoplasty, and canthoplasty, which are just fancy jargon for saying that she had plastic surgeons work around her eyes and eyelids.&nbsp;</p><p>The epicanthoplasty allegedly resulted in her inner eye corner being wider while the outer eye corner was stretched outwards. All in all, her eyes got a more almond-like shape, and her bottom eyelids were straighter than before.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Blepharoplasty, on the other hand, is done to remove excess skin from above one's eyes, which tightens the skin and prevents it from drooping downwards.&nbsp;</p><h2>Other Counts of Plastic Surgery</h2><p>Following suit, many argued&nbsp;Manoban also got a chin implant and lip fillers for a more defined overall shape. Not just that, they speculated&nbsp;she had an upper lip lift and lip corner lift done.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Fans also took notice of the fact that the Kpop star's cheeks haven't always been the same. At times, they looked puffier, and they even claimed that they looked unnatural at one point.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She allegedly underwent another procedure called buccal fat removal and hence got a better facial structure. However, they refused to believe that the fat loss was a consequence of weight loss because, if so, she would have had to lose a lot of weight in the process.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Last but not least, she was also said to have had jaw fillers, another jaw surgery, and skin bleaching for her complexion.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKSZqK5uucCnppuZnmK9ra3SraCcZaOqv6ix0bJloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lynn-hartman.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lynn Hartman</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-jack-grealish-partied-shirtless-in-ibiza-while-his-girlfriend-was-away.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Jack Grealish Partied Shirtless in Ibiza While His Girlfriend Was Away</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./raising-the-staal-brothers-hard-work-humility-and-family.html>Raising the Staal Brothers: Hard work, humility and family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./about-davido-his-kids-age-family-and-parents.html>About Davido, His Kids, Age, Family and Parents</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aurora-teagarden-mysteries-order-watch-movie-chronologically-by-release-date.html>Aurora Teagarden Mysteries Order, Watch Movie Chronologically, by Release Date</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kimberly-woodruff.html>Kimberly Woodruff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nyjer-morgan-net-worth-pulptastic.html>Nyjer Morgan Net Worth - Pulptastic</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnogBlogy.
