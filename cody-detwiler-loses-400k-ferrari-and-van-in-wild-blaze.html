Tis But A Scratch! We will be back Ferrari…”</p><p>The video begins by showing Detwiler, in Waco, Texas, showing off his new car — burning rubber and speeding through an empty corn field surrounded by dry grass.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p>Suddenly, his right tire is seen catching on fire. Detwiler’s friends in the van scream at him, while in the driver’s seat, that his car is on fire and he comes to a halt.</p><p>Attempts to stop the flames were immediately thwarted as they spread in seconds, catching onto the nearby van as well.</p><p>“We are off road, we were going into a cornfield the vehicles are on fire, we need a fire department immediately,” one of Detwiler’s friends can be heard saying on the phone to cops.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The Ferrari’s back right tire caught fire. <span class=credit>YouTube/WhistlinDiesel</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The fire quickly spread to the second vehicle — the mini van. <span class=credit>YouTube/WhistlinDiesel</span></figure><p>In a matter of all but 5 minutes, both vehicles had burned to a crisp, leaving nothing but a few auto parts behind.</p><p>“I don’t care about the cars, it’s fine.” Detwiler said. “Just keep it from spreading onto the field.”</p><p>“Do I even have insurance on this car?” Detwiler can be heard asking his friend. “I think if I do, it’s like the most minimal — like we’ll pay for other people’s damage. I don’t have full coverage on anything. They won’t give it to me.”</p><p>“They’re like, ‘he’s gonna cause an accident, burn the car down,'” he quipped.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">In minutes, after an attempt to water down the fire, it quickly consumed both cars. <span class=credit>YouTube/WhistlinDiesel</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Cody Detwiler said he did not have full coverage because insurance companies would not give it to him. <span class=credit>YouTube/WhistlinDiesel</span></figure><p>“Yeah, that’s what happened. The insurance companies were right,” his friend replied.</p><p>The carbon ceramics and the brand new $8,000 titanium exhaust seem to be the only salvageable parts, Detwiler noticed after assessing the damage.</p><p>“It was a total loss.” Detwiler said. “We f–ked up.”</p><p>Despite some fans commenting that Detwiler set up the whole thing and intentionally caused the fire for views, he says this was very much an accident.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">In about 5 minutes the $400,000 car was completely gone and burned to a crisp. <span class=credit>YouTube/WhistlinDiesel</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Police and the fire department were called to help contain the blaze. <span class=credit>YouTube/WhistlinDiesel</span></figure><p>“No this wasn’t staged. Anyone that can read human body language can tell this was real,” Detwiler said in a statement. “Why would I also burn up a RENTAL van with all of our stuff inside? My shoes, headphones, sunglasses, sentimental Polaroid photos, tools, spare wheels and tires, and cameraman’s gear also burnt. Sure I make money destroying things, but I don’t lie. Not everything is a conspiracy.”</p><p>With a net worth of about $5 million, Detwiler revealed that he was not concerned that the car burned and that he would replace it with another Ferrari.</p><p>The clip has already racked up over 5 million views since it was uploaded online on Aug. 18.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Fma2lfmLylxYydnK2vmaGys3nLqKqeq11pfXG3jJ%2Bcq6qRp7Zurc2dZK%2BZnmK2r3nWoqOdZZKhrruxjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./everything-you-need-to-know-about-connie-sellecca-s-daughter-prima-tesh.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Everything You Need To Know About Connie Sellecca s Daughter Prima Tesh!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bayan-shafe-shekaru-ba-a-ji-duriyarta-ba-jaruma-kubura-dako-ta-bayyana-cikin-wani-yanayi-a-wani-hot.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bayan shafe shekaru ba a ji duriyarta ba, jaruma Kubura Dako ta bayyana cikin wani yanayi a wani hot</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./raising-the-staal-brothers-hard-work-humility-and-family.html>Raising the Staal Brothers: Hard work, humility and family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./about-davido-his-kids-age-family-and-parents.html>About Davido, His Kids, Age, Family and Parents</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aurora-teagarden-mysteries-order-watch-movie-chronologically-by-release-date.html>Aurora Teagarden Mysteries Order, Watch Movie Chronologically, by Release Date</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kimberly-woodruff.html>Kimberly Woodruff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nyjer-morgan-net-worth-pulptastic.html>Nyjer Morgan Net Worth - Pulptastic</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnogBlogy.
