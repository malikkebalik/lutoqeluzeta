No, he wasn’t getting paid in loads of Benjamins, but something much, much worse: pennies.</p><p>That’s right. Have you ever wondered how much $915 in pennies weigh? Well, according to Flaten about 504 pounds. And to add infinite insult to injury, Flaten’s lousy boss, Miles Walker of <strong>AOK Walker Luxury Autoworks</strong> in Peachtree City, GA greased up all 91,000 pennies in slick oil.</p><p>Per most banks, loose coins must be clean to be processed, meaning Flaten must work even more to spend the money that he rightfully earned.</p><p>The mountain of pennies was topped with Flaten’s last paystub and a simple note that said, “F* you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/odometer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/a06317ae84264596a4ef7afa9a096a06317-1.png><h3>Andreas Flaten’s former employer who sent him the greasy pennies, Miles Walker.</h3><p>Flaten told CBS-affiliate WGCL-TV that he quit the job back in November due to its hostile, harassment-filled environment and constant turnover. Five other former employees have backed up Flaten’s claims including a woman who said Walker depantsed her in front of customers as a joke.</p><p>When Flaten put his notice in, he said he could tell that his boss was upset.</p><p>“He froze and stared at me for like a straight minute,” Flaten said during an interview. “He gets up, puts his hands on his head, walks out the door, and disappears.”</p><p>Sounds like some psycho behavior to me.</p><p>At the time, Walker still owed Flaten $915 for work he performed at the auto shop, but after five months Flaten assumed he wasn’t getting his money. That’s when Walker dumped the wheelbarrow of pennies on Flaten’s property in the middle of the night. Flaten says the coins are so heavy that the tires on the wheelbarrow have already given out.</p><p>“I think that’s going to be a lot of work for money I’ve already worked for,” he said in an <a href=#>interview</a> with FOX 5 Atlanta, calling it “a childish thing to do.”</p><p>“It’s going to be hours upon hours of just cleaning this money up so that it’s even able to be spent. It’s definitely not fair at all,” he added.</p><p>When confronted by reporters about the spiteful stunt, Walker was dismissive but eventually shot back&nbsp;saying, “It doesn’t matter, he got paid, that’s all that matter. He’s a f<strong>*</strong> weenie for even bringing it up.”</p><p>In the meantime, AOK Walker Luxury Autoworks has gotten showered with one-star reviews online since the story broke.</p><p>Check out the full WGCL report here:</p><p class="imported-embed imported-embed-youtube"></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminlKS6psDEq2Wcp51ku6bD0miYp5%2BirnqiwdOoZKygn6V6sMPNnqlmqJGuwG6yzquknqpdmrqxuM6ynJ5lmaN6en2UaWdmn6KarrTFjKmcp6aZmsBw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./carmen-aub-net-worth-pulptastic.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Carmen Aub Net Worth - Pulptastic</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tokio-hotel-don-t-jump-lyrics.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tokio Hotel Don't Jump Lyrics</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./raising-the-staal-brothers-hard-work-humility-and-family.html>Raising the Staal Brothers: Hard work, humility and family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./about-davido-his-kids-age-family-and-parents.html>About Davido, His Kids, Age, Family and Parents</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aurora-teagarden-mysteries-order-watch-movie-chronologically-by-release-date.html>Aurora Teagarden Mysteries Order, Watch Movie Chronologically, by Release Date</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kimberly-woodruff.html>Kimberly Woodruff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nyjer-morgan-net-worth-pulptastic.html>Nyjer Morgan Net Worth - Pulptastic</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnogBlogy.
