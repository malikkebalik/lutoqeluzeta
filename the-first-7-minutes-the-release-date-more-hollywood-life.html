The show started streaming on Netflix where it became a hit, and fans led a campaign to save the show that even <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Stephen King&nbsp;</strong>supported</a>. Eventually, Netflix renewed the show for a fourth and final season, which will be broken up into two parts.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Manifest&nbsp;was created by <strong>Jeff Rake</strong> and premiered on September 24, 2018. The show centers on a group of passengers and crew of a commercial airline plane that goes missing in the air, only to reappear 5 years later. Everyone on the plane was presumed dead, so the entire world is shocked when they show up as if nothing happened. Here’s everything we know so far about Manifest&nbsp;season 4, including the release date, cast, and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Manifest-Season-4-Netflix-embed-1.jpg><h2>Manifest Season 4 Release Date</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Part 1 of&nbsp;Manifest&nbsp;season 4 will premiere on November 4, 2022. All 10 episodes of Part 1 will drop that day so fans can binge-watch right away on Netflix. Part 2 will also feature 10 episodes, though Netflix has yet to reveal a premiere date for the final episodes of the series. Season 4 is premiering over one year after the season 3 finale aired on June 10, 2021.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>Jeff Rake</strong> had a six-season plan mapped out for Manifest, but NBC still canceled the show after three seasons on June 10, 2021. Warner Bros. started licensing the show to Netflix, where it immediately debuted at the top of Netflix’s Top Ten charts. After six weeks, the show surpassed 1 billion minutes viewed. However, Warner Bros. announced at the end of June 2021 that the show wouldn’t be moving to Netflix after brief negations between the two companies. But Jeff Rake didn’t give up and continued pitching to save Manifest, with help from a fan-made <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Change.org petition</a> that amassed over 95,000 signatures. “W<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">e’re trying to find a way to conclude the series.

That was fitting since the plane that goes missing in the show is Flight 828. Jeff reacted to the exciting news in a statement, saying, “What started years ago as a flight of fancy deep in my imagination has evolved into the jet engine journey of a lifetime. Never in my wildest dreams could I have envisioned the worldwide outpouring of love and support for this story, its characters, and the team who work so hard to bring it all to life. That we will be able to reward the fans with the ending they deserve moves me to no end. On behalf of the cast, the crew, the writers, directors, and producers, thank you to Netflix, to Warner Bros., and of course to the fans. You did this.” The cast began filming the final season in New York City in November 2021 and wrapped during the summer of 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Jeff also discussed Netflix saving&nbsp;Manifest&nbsp;in an interview in August 2022. “It was just euphoric,” he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tudum</a>, Netflix’s official companion website.&nbsp;“It’s hard to deny that there’s something kind of divinely inspired about this pickup and that the universe has been looking out for us.

The show will no longer air on network television on NBC. Parts 1 and 2 of the 20-episode final season will be released separately on the streaming service.</p><h2>What Do We Know About What Will Happen Next Season?</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Netflix released the official description for&nbsp;Manifest&nbsp;Season 4 on August 28, 2022: “Two years after the brutal murder of Grace turned their lives upside down, the Stone family is in shambles as a devastated Ben continues to mourn his wife and search for his kidnapped daughter, Eden. Consumed by his grief, Ben has stepped down from his role as co-captain of the lifeboat, leaving Michaela to captain it alone, a near-impossible feat with the passengers’ every move now being monitored by a government registry. As the Death Date draws closer and the passengers grow desperate for a path to survival, a mysterious passenger arrives with a package for Cal that changes everything they know about Flight 828 and will prove to be the key to unlocking the secret of the Callings in this compelling, mind-bending, and deeply emotional journey,” the description reads.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>Netflix also released a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>one-minute teaser</a> for the new season on August 28, which can be seen above. It shows big moments that happened in the first three seasons and some new footage from season 4. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The official trailer</a> was released on September 24, 2022.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Manifest-Netflix-update-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-19><strong>HollywoodLife</strong> spoke EXCLUSIVELY with<strong> Josh Dallas</strong> and <strong>Melissa Roxburgh</strong> ahead of Part 1’s premiere about what to expect from Ben and Michaela. Josh revealed that Ben is “not handling” Grace’s death well. “He is still stuck in this profound grief and anger. He’s not willing to let it go. I think he’s afraid to let it go because I think he feels that he’ll lose Grace forever in some strange way if he doesn’t hold on to his grief,” he said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>Josh also noted that Ben’s grief complicates his feelings for his son, Cal. “He’s dealing with his son who is not only older in age that he’s supposed to be, but there is some complicated feelings that I think Ben has that he blames Cal in some ways for Grace’s death,” Josh continued.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>As for Michaela, Melissa told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> that Michaela’s love life remains complicated. “She’s obviously very much in love with Zeke but also has a profound love for Jared. We get to see the result of her decision based on that comment from Jared going into season 4, and the triangle does not die,” Melissa teased.</p><h2>Manifest Season 4 Cast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Manifest-Netflix-update-embed4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-22>Most of the&nbsp;Manifest&nbsp;cast is returning despite all the drama with the cancellation and moving to Netflix. <strong>Josh Dallas&nbsp;</strong>is back as Ben Stone, who was on Flight 828.&nbsp;<strong>Melissa Roxburgh&nbsp;</strong>is returning as Ben’s sister and fellow Flight 828 passenger Michaela Stone.

Ty made his first appearance in the season 3 finale.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Manifest-Netflix-update-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-24>Season 4 will welcome some new characters as well. They include Flight 828 passengers Henry Kim and Kyle Boyd. Tela and June are two Indigenous characters who will be introduced. Netflix hasn’t revealed anything else about these new characters. It’s also possible that Josh’s wife and <i><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Once&nbsp;Upon a Time</a>&nbsp;</i>co-star&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ginnifer Goodwin</a> </strong>appears in the new season. Ginnifer posted a selfie of herself on a Montego Airways plane and wrote “@joshdallas is taking me on a trip somewhere,” hinting that she may appear on her hubby’s hit show.</p><h2>Who Is On The Creative Team For Season 4?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-25>Jeff Rake will continue to be in charge of all things&nbsp;Manifest at Netflix. Some of the directors for the new seasons have also been revealed. <strong>Romeo Tirone&nbsp;</strong>is directing the Part 1 premiere, which is titled “Touch and Go.” <strong>Dean White</strong> will direct episode 2, <strong>SJ Main Munoz</strong> will direct episode 3, Josh will direct episode 7, and <strong>Erica Watson</strong> will direct episode 8. In Part 2, <strong>Claire Fowler</strong> will direct episode 14 which is titled “Fata Morgana.”</p><h2>What is the Budget for Manifest Season 4?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-26>Thanks to Netflix, the budget for&nbsp;Manifest&nbsp;increased for the fourth and final season. Per reports, the show’s episodic budget went from $4 million to $5 million, while creator Jeff Rake and the full cast get a pay increase, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ScreenRant</a>.
