He was also removed from “New Zealand X Factor” in 2015 due to bad behavior towards one of the contestants. However, all of his endeavors have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Willy Moon? As of early-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $3 million, mostly earned through a career in music. He has also been featured in numerous high profile publications. As he continues his career it is expected that his wealth will increase.</p><h3>Willy Moon Net Worth $3 million</h3><p>Willy left New Zealand when he was 18 and moved to Berlin, then to London before moving to New York City. He started to earn a bit of recognition when he released the song “I Wanna Be Your Man” through MySpace. He was noticed and given a deal with Island Records which helped start to lift his net worth. He also released two singles through Luv Luv Luv Records. His production style caught the attention of many which led him to be featured in Vogue, The Guardian, Q Magazine, and GQ. According to reports, he mixed hip-hop production techniques with modern production style and 50s rock n’ roll. In 2012, he released the single “Yeah Yeah” which was featured on BBC Radio 1; the song led him to perform live in numerous venues including the show “Later… with <a href=#>Jools Holland</a>”, and would be used by Apple in advertising the iPod Touch, Nano, and Shuffle. It was also featured in the video game “Forza Horizon”.</p><p>He then released two singles “Bang Bang” and “Railroad Track” through the label Third Man Records, and then Willy would tour around the US to promote his songs, while his net worth continued to increase thanks to their impact; he was featured in “The Tonight Show with <a href=#>Jay Leno</a>”. Soon he would work on his debut album, released in 2013 called “Here’s Willy Moon”, which featured all of his popular songs released up to this point. The video game “Grand Theft Auto V” would include the song “Railroad Track” in their playlist, and the trailer of “Assassin’s Creed Black Flag” also featured the song. Since then, most of his songs have been featured in various advertisements.</p><p>In 2015, Willy was cast as a mentor and judge for “X Factor New Zealand” alongside his wife, but after the first live screening, both of them were fired because they humiliated and bullied a contestant. The issue spread quickly on social media and led to a petition to fire them both from the show. The show’s producers and judges also voiced their disapproval of the incident.<br>Since then Moon has become part of the band Cruel Youth alongside his wife, and they’ve released several songs.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Moon has been married to singer <a href=#>Natalia Kills</a> since 2014; the couple normally reside in New York City.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<h3 class=toggle-head>Soundtrack <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=soundtrack readability=4><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Edge of Tomorrow</td><td>2014</td><td>performer: "Railroad Track" / writer: "Railroad Track"</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>90210</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=6><td>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</td><td></td><td>TV Series performer - 1 episode, 2012 writer - 1 episode, 2012</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=2><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>The X Factor New Zealand</td><td>2014-2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Judge</td></tr><tr><td>How I Rock It</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Taratata</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Sunday</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Big Morning Buzz Live with Nick Lachey</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Musical Guest</td></tr><tr><td>Tracks</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</td><td>2012</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Musical Guest</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Archive Footage <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjrCgpaSpYrqwu81mpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./written-in-blood-tab-by-alex-g-sandy-alex-g.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>WRITTEN IN BLOOD TAB by Alex G ((Sandy) Alex G)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tom-watson-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tom Watson | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./raising-the-staal-brothers-hard-work-humility-and-family.html>Raising the Staal Brothers: Hard work, humility and family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./about-davido-his-kids-age-family-and-parents.html>About Davido, His Kids, Age, Family and Parents</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aurora-teagarden-mysteries-order-watch-movie-chronologically-by-release-date.html>Aurora Teagarden Mysteries Order, Watch Movie Chronologically, by Release Date</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kimberly-woodruff.html>Kimberly Woodruff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nyjer-morgan-net-worth-pulptastic.html>Nyjer Morgan Net Worth - Pulptastic</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnogBlogy.
