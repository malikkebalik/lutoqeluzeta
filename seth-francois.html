Seth was born under the sign of Aries, according to his birth date.</p><h2><span id=Seth_Francois8217_parents_hometown_and_ethnicity>Seth Francois’ parents, hometown, and ethnicity</span></h2><p>Seth Francois grew up in Sacramento, California, but his hometown is Lancaster, California. He was given the name “Joseph” after his parents, Seth and Joi.</p><p>His father was a musician in his youth, according to reports. Furthermore, the majority of his relatives were musicians, models, actors, and so on. As a result, he developed an early interest in the entertainment industry. Seth is African American in ethnicity. He was also the only Black member of the Vlog Squad.</p><p>Seth attended Elk Grove High School because of his education. Seth was interested in studying music after he graduated. He then studied audio production at the Art Institute of California, Los Angeles. Soon after, he created and directed his first music video, Cherry Red.</p><p>He lived in Tempe, Arizona in 2021.</p><h2><span id=Height_Weight_and_Distinctive_Characteristics>Height, Weight, and Distinctive Characteristics</span></h2><p><strong>Seth Francois is 5 feet 11 inches (180 cm) tall and weighs more than 80 kg (176 lbs).</strong></p><p>Seth has brown eyes and bleached hair, which are two of his distinguishing characteristics (in Feb 2021). He also has a tattoo on his arm that says “CERTIFIED,” which is the name of his company.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Instagram_Facebook_and_Twitter><span class="TextRun SCXW110891071 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=auto><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW110891071 BCX8" data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2">Social Media: Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW110891071 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559738":40,"335559739":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>As of February 2021, Seth had 99.2K Instagram followers, 8.3K Twitter followers, 17.6K YouTube subscribers, and a private Facebook account @seth.francois.71.</p><p>Seth’s company “Certified Casting” also has 11.7K Instagram followers and 483 Facebook followers.</p><h2><span id=Seth_Francois_Business_and_YouTube_Earnings>Seth Francois Business, and YouTube Earnings</span></h2><p>According to reports, he earns between $1.7K and $107K per year from YouTube.Aside from YouTube, Seth’s main source of income was his company, “Sertified Casting” — a casting agency for social media content creation with offices in Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Phoenix.</p><p>Seth’s rise to fame began in college, when he met his now-best friend and business associate Dominykas Zegliatis, a.k.a. Durte Dom. In LA, the two threw a lot of house parties and made a lot of friends. Soon after, he became well-known, and people began approaching him through self-promotion.</p><p>However, Seth quickly ran out of resources and began to burn out. He revealed,</p><p>“I was sleeping in my car, my phone was the only way I could communicate with all of these people, and I couldn’t even afford to pay the bill.”</p><p>Then he met Jordan Sweat, who promised him a job as a production assistant on a movie set in Atlanta. So Seth traveled to Atlanta, explored the city, and did exactly what he did in LA: formed organic friendships and prompted his casting agency.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_worth_of_Seth_Francois><span class="TextRun SCXW209883063 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=none><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW209883063 BCX8">What is the Net worth of Seth Francois?</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW209883063 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p><strong>In 2021, Seth Francois’s net worth was less than $500 thousand.</strong></p><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>Seth Francois estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.

His previous girlfriends’ records were not discovered at the time.</p><h2><span id=Revenge_Porn8217s_Seth_Francois_Erin_Gilfoy>Revenge Porn’s Seth Francois Erin Gilfoy</span></h2><p>Seth Francois posted a “revenge porn” of a fellow Vlog Squad member, Erin Gilfoy, to his Twitter in mid-2020, and she was furious. Though Seth claimed that the videos “weren’t monetized, nor was there any nudity in the video,” Erin claimed that they were “revenge porn.” In response to Seth’s tweet, she wrote,</p><p>“Blurry or not blurry or not blurry or not, monetized or not. You do not have a say because IT IS NOT YOUR BODY! Yes, what I say in it is horrible, and I am ashamed of myself, but it is also disgusting that you are using my trauma to hold me accountable.”</p><p>In addition, fans were irritated by the situation. Many people advised Erin to sue Seth for his actions.</p><h2><span id=Francois_Seth_Sexual_Assault_Josh_Nash_David_Dobrik>Francois, Seth Sexual Assault, Josh Nash, David Dobrik</span></h2><p>Aside from the racist jokes, Seth Francois revealed that the prank played on him by Josh Nash hurt him the most and left him “still experiencing trauma.” He revealed,</p><p>“I honestly didn’t realize how much that situation affected me until COVID happened at the beginning of last year. I remember sitting in my Atlanta hotel room thinking to myself, “That video was wrong.” That shouldn’t have happened to me, I just felt.”</p><p>Seth was pranked by Josh in the video titled “HE THOUGHT HE WAS KISSING HER!! (SUPER CRINGEY),” where Seth was tricked into kissing another Vlog Squad member, Corinna (who in fact was Josh in disguise).</p><p>Seth claims he never consented to the kiss with Nash. He knew it felt “wrong,” so he dialed a sexual assault hotline. To which he was replied,</p><p>“‘I’m sorry you were sexually abused.”</p><p>Seth then broke down and called his mother and a few close friends to tell them what had happened to him. Later, he discussed it with David and Nash, but instead of acknowledging it, they offered him money. Though Seth left the Vlog Squad in 2018, he stated that he is speaking now to “teach a lesson” about power abuse and to help others who have experienced similar “trauma.”</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Musician</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Daisuke Ishiwatari</a></h3>Daisuke Ishiwatari estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
