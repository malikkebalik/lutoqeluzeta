His voice sparked an undying love and support for the country artist, which has continued to grow strong.</p><p class=dh>After their romance began in high school, they tied the knot several years later and began expanding their brood.

Laney was a popular cheerleader, and Walker was too nervous to go up and speak with her.</p><p class=dh>That was until they both participated in a school production called "Little Shop of Horrors." She and Walker did an "Ask Me Anything" session on Instagram in 2020, where they shared a few words about their first interaction, with Laney <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL4a3gYuEhY&t=34s">saying</a>:</p><p class=dh>"He started singing.

For their first date, he recalled visiting a Genie at a construction site during his interview on "The Bobby Bones Show." To commemorate the special night, he drew her a picture, which she took for safekeeping.</p><p class=dh>Afterward, the lovebirds spent hours talking. They dated for seven years before tying the knot on June 12, 2004. About a month before their 15 anniversary, in 2019, Walker posted a 1997 throwback picture of him and Laney <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.instagram.com/p/BxaGFK4FL_n/>all snuggled up</a> as they smiled at the camera.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Laney Beville Hayes Never Doubted Her Husband's Dreams</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>"She's been beside me guys, she's thrown a lot of heartbreaks along this wave and never once did the woman ever say, 'hey you think you want to have a more normal ambition or a more realistic dream.'

However, when the time came for Laney to give birth, things took an unfavorable and dire turn.
