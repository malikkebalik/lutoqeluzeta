He passed away on the 13th September 2011.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Richard Hamilton was, at the time of his death? Not unusually with artists, sources cannot establish his specific net worth, however, his art has made him or his estate worth multi-millions, the values of which may well continue to increase.</p><h3>Richard William Hamilton Net Worth $500,000</h3><p>Richard left school, and found a job as an apprentice at an electrical components firm. While working there, he discovered his ability to draw, and soon enough enrolled at Saint Martin’s School of Art. After a short time he enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools, but when the war broke out, he was forced to work as a technical draftsman, and so quit his education. After the War, he returned to the Royal Academy, but was expelled, due to “not profiting from the instruction”, stated by the school`s officials. Nevertheless, he then entered the Slade School of Art, University College, London.</p><p>His professional career really began two years later, when his first exhibition saw the light of the day, held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts. At the same time he worked as a teacher at the Central School of Art and Design, so his net worth was established.<br>Since then his career went only upwards; his early works became extremely popular, including “Growth and Form”, and “Man, Machine and Motion”. In 1956 he was a part of the art exhibition “This Is Tomorrow”, exhibiting his own work, “Just what is it that makes today’s homes so different, so appealing?”.</p><p>Little by little his name became more known in the London art scene, and he used the first chance to expand abroad. Throughout his career, Richard held exhibitions across Europe, in cities such as Berlin in 1974, Amsterdam in 1976, Bielefeld 1978, Edinburgh, 1988 and a year later in Stockholm, Winterthur 1990 and also in the 1990s he held his first exhibition in San Francisco, at the Museum of Modern Art. In the 2000s, he held several further successful exhibitions, including the ‘A Host of Angels’ in 2007 in Venice, ‘Pixelated Angels in Virtual Spaces’ in 2008 in Bielefeld, and ‘Modern Moral Matters’ in 2010 in London, which was his last exhibition before his death.</p><p>During his career, Richard received numerous prestigious awards, including the William and Noma Copley Foundation Award, 1960, and the same year he received the John Moores Contemporary Painting Prize. He was also the recipient of Talens Prize International award in 1970, and of the Arnold Bode Prize in 1996. In 1999 he was made a Companion of Honour, and as laye in his life as 2006, he won the Max Beckmann Prize for painting.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Richard was married to Rita Donagh from 1991 until his death in 1991. Previously, he was married to Terry, but she died in a car accident in the early 1960s.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=4.0284431137725><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$500,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 24, 1922</td></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>September 13, 2011</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Pimlico, United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Painter, artist</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>Royal Academy of Arts, Slade School of Fine Art, Central Saint Martins</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>British</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Rita Donagh (m. 1991–2011), Terry O'Reilly (m. 1947–1962)</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1713518/</a></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Heads</td><td>1969</td><td>Short</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Greetings</td><td>1968</td><td></td><td>Pop Artist</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Art Department <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=art_department readability=2><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Painting with Light</td><td>1987</td><td>TV Mini-Series artist - 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Shock of the New</td><td>1980</td><td>TV Mini-Series documentary designer - 1 episode</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Dieter Roth</td><td>2003</td><td>Documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Painting with Light</td><td>1987</td><td>TV Mini-Series</td><td>Himself - Artist</td></tr><tr><td>Arena</td><td>1975</td><td>TV Series documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Richard Hamilton</td><td>1969</td><td>Short</td><td>Himself</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Archive Footage <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><h3>Known for movies</h3><figure class=gallery-item readability=1><p>Greetings (1968)<br>as Pop Artist</p></figure><figure class=gallery-item readability=1><p>Richard Hamilton (1969)<br>as Himself</p></figure><figure class=gallery-item readability=1><p>Painting with Light (1987)<br>as Art Department</p></figure><figure class=gallery-item readability=1><p>Dieter Roth (2003)<br>as Himself</p></figure><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqugnKCRp7Fuw8ilo6KZnWK1ornIpauopl2jsrV51qipraBf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tiger-woods-niece-cheyenne-woods-is-a-professional-golfer-whose-net-worth-is-300-000.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tiger Woods' niece, Cheyenne Woods is a professional golfer whose net worth is $300,000.</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./reports-manchester-united-considering-terminating-jadon-sancho-s-contract.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Reports: Manchester United considering terminating Jadon Sanchos contract</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./raising-the-staal-brothers-hard-work-humility-and-family.html>Raising the Staal Brothers: Hard work, humility and family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./about-davido-his-kids-age-family-and-parents.html>About Davido, His Kids, Age, Family and Parents</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aurora-teagarden-mysteries-order-watch-movie-chronologically-by-release-date.html>Aurora Teagarden Mysteries Order, Watch Movie Chronologically, by Release Date</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kimberly-woodruff.html>Kimberly Woodruff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nyjer-morgan-net-worth-pulptastic.html>Nyjer Morgan Net Worth - Pulptastic</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnogBlogy.
