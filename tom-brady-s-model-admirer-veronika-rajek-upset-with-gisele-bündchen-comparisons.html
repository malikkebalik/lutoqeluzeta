Void the noise and trust yourself. 💛,” <a href=#>Rajek wrote</a> in a post that included a series of sultry bikini photos.</p><p>The Slovakian model is seen posing in a yellow string bikini by Be Ocean while on a bed at Orchid Beach House in Tulum — a luxury adults only resort. The <a href=#>standard rate</a> for one night in a beach front room at Orchid Beach House is $11,091. Other standard rooms run around $7,308.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Veronika Rajek at Orchid Beach House in Tulum on Feb. 2, 2023. <span class=credit>Instagram</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Veronika Rajek at Orchid Beach House in Tulum on Feb. 2, 2023. <span class=credit>Instagram</span></figure><p>Rajek has been widely compared to Bündchen — who’s one of the top-earning super models in the world — since she began sharing her support for Brady on Instagram.</p><p>In December, Rajek sported a No. 12 Brady jersey white attending the Buccaneers-Saints game at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. After that, the model has shared a number of supportive posts about Brady on Instagram.</p><p>Rajek also <a href=#>shared a retirement message </a>of her own after Brady announced on Wednesday that <a href=#>he’s retiring for good </a>after 23 NFL seasons.</p><span class=screen-reader-text>Previous</span><p><span>1</span> of <span>9</span></p><span class=screen-reader-text>Next</span><p class="ad__label ad__label--top">Advertisement</p><p>At one point, Rajek was accused of publicly flirting with Brady after his split from Bündchen.</p><p>“People compare us but I am not Gisele. I’m Veronika – I’m totally different,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rajek previously told The Sun.</a> “She is amazing, she is one of a kind. I love every post that she shares. It’s not good people are comparing me and Gisele — when they found her in Brazil in 1994 I wasn’t even born. She looks beautiful and amazing, her body after two kids is perfect.</p><p>“When we are comparing the young models, you can compare me with the girls like Bella Hadid, Hailey Bieber, or Kendall Jenner. They are models but I am a model too, just I never had opportunities because I wasn’t born in the States.”</p><p>The ex-couple announced that they<a href=#> finalized their divorce in October, </a>following 13 years of marriage. That came after Page Six was first to report in September that they were navigating martial issues.</p><p>Brady and Bündchen <a href=#>have two children together</a>, daughter Vivian, 10, and 13-year-old son Benjamin. The NFL legend also has a 15-year-old son Jack with his ex, actress Bridget Moynahan.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen attend the Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 6, 2019 in New York City. <span class=credit>Patrick McMullan via Getty Image</span></figure><p>On Thursday, Rajek also took to her Instagram Story to address direct messages she received from people expressing concern about her body.</p><p>“My last picture, with my super skinny body, [made] emotion in a few people, OK maybe more than a few people,” Rajek said. “No I do not have a food disorder. I eat normally. I’m just a super picky person. Everybody who knows me, they know it’s really hard with me to go to a restaurant because it’s really hard to impress me with food.</p><p>“Also, I eat only five or six meals all year long, not because I’m on a special diet, but because I don’t like the taste of other food. I don’t like fish, I don’t like seafood, I don’t like oysters. I don’t eat a lot of meat… People who know me and they’re my friends, they know I’m running on the sugar and maybe it’s not healthy, but my body is healthy and I love it. So you don’t need to be afraid for my health. I’m totally fine.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Veronika Rajek at the Buccaneers-Saints game at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida on Dec. 5, 2022. <span class=credit>Instagram/Veronika Rajek</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady in a game against the San Francisco 49ers at Levi’s Stadium on Dec. 11, 2022 in Santa Clara, California. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Rajek added that she is 5-foot-11 and 125 pounds.</p><p>“It’s normal because I work out six times per week, not because I want to be skinnier, I just love to do it,” Rajek said. “For me, it’s like therapy, it’s my time, it’s me time, nobody’s disturbing me for [an hour and a half]… Nothing’s wrong on this, please respect it that I just love to move because my old childhood was about sport and my high school was about sport and my whole life will always be about sport. I’m not a professional athlete but this is my lifestyle.”</p><p>Rajek also denied having a nose surgery, saying, “It’s called bronzer.” She added that her latest bikini photos were taken without makeup, and that she was only wearing SPF powder and bronzer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2tmaWtfqbyuecGrmJ2xo2K6sLDEpWSanJ2ev6a%2BjK%2Bcq6eenriiedGaoZ6jXaq9tLHTZq6irJhitKq%2FxKWcZpqlo7GktMSnZJynnaWus7XSqKWsZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./david-gandy-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>David Gandy Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paul-f-tompkins-bio-wiki.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Paul F.
