The team was a shadow of its former self. The energetic dynamism that defined the rest of the Klopp era was conspicuous by its absence.</p><p>But the Reds rallied to finish the season strongly, collecting&nbsp; points from the last . That was not enough for them to squeeze into the top four, but it did allow Liverpool to build momentum going into the summer.</p><p>The positive feeling was maintained by the successful regeneration of the midfield, a much-needed issue.&nbsp;</p><p>The crucial factor, though, is that Liverpool have made a bright start to the current campaign. After nine rounds of fixtures they sit fourth in the standings, just three points off Tottenham Hotspur in top spot.</p><p>They warmed up for the visit of Nottingham Forest this weekend by thrashing Toulouse 5-1 in the Europa League on Thursday.</p><p>Liverpool are not quite back to the level at which Klopp‚Äôs best teams at Anfield were operating, but the doom and gloom of last term has been dispelled.</p><p>The manager himself looks re-energised and there are no longer any questions about whether his time at Liverpool might be up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/10/1-2.jpg><h2>üìù Liverpool vs Nottingham Forest betting tips</h2><p>Liverpool should have too much quality for Nottingham Forest when the two teams go head-to-head this weekend.</p><h3>Liverpool to win to nil - 5/4 (bet365)</h3><p>Make no mistake, there is still room for improvement at Liverpool. Klopp‚Äôs strongest sides were not just exhilarating in attack, they were solid at the back too.</p><p>The Reds are currently giving up too many chances for their manager‚Äôs liking. They may have only conceded nine goals in the Premier League, but they rank only sixth in the expected goals against table.</p><p>That will have to change if Liverpool are to challenge Manchester City - and perhaps Arsenal and Tottenham - for the Premier League title.</p><p>Klopp‚Äôs men have conceded in nine of their 13 matches in all competitions to date, which means they have kept a clean sheet in only 30 per cent of their total contests.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Free Bet Offers</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/08/JW-TALKSPORT-BETTING-FREE-BETS-v2.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Claim all the best free bet offers all season</p><p>That record could improve this weekend. Nottingham Forest were the worst-performing team away from home last season.</p><p>They did win at Stamford Bridge in early September but Forest have failed to score in their last two matches at opposition grounds.</p><p>Liverpool successfully shut out Everton - albeit with a numerical advantage - in their last Premier League fixture, and we like their chances of picking up another victory while keeping a clean sheet in this one.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>‚öΩ <strong><a aria-label="Back Arsenal to win to nil at evens with bet365 (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Back Liverpool to win to nil at 5/4 with bet365</a></strong> ‚öΩ</p><h3>Liverpool -2 handicap - 13/8 (bet365)</h3><p>Liverpool were far too strong in Toulouse on Thursday night. They had five different scorers in their 5-1 triumph, as Diogo Jota, Wataru Endo, Darwin Nunez, Ryan Gravenberch and Mohamed Salah all found the net.</p><p>It was yet another successful match at Anfield for the hosts. They have not lost any game in front of their own fans since Real Madrid ran out 5-2 winners there in February.</p><p>Meanwhile you have to go back to 25 October 2022 to find the last time Liverpool were beaten on home turf in the Premier League, with Leeds United the victors on that occasion.</p><p>The Reds have won all seven of their home games this season, making this a daunting proposition for Nottingham Forest - particularly as the East Midlanders have not emerged triumphant from a trip to Anfield since 1969, when Klopp was just two years old.</p><p>Liverpool should ultimately have too much in attack for Forest. Each of their four Premier League wins in 2023/24 has been by a two-goal margin, an outcome which would result in your stake being returned with this bet.</p><p>But there is reason to believe that Klopp‚Äôs side can go one better this weekend. Confidence is high and this could end up being a one-sided encounter.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>‚öΩ <strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Choose a Liverpool win with a -2 handicap at 13/8 with bet365</a></strong> ‚öΩ</p><h3>Mohamed Salah to score any time - Evens (bet365)</h3><p>Liverpool came under sustained pressure towards the end of the summer transfer window, with the Saudi Pro League desperate to prise Salah away from the club.&nbsp;</p><p>In pure financial terms, it would have made sense for Liverpool to sell the Egypt international for a world-record fee.</p><p>But doing so would have in effect represented a writing-off of this season, and Klopp was not prepared to do that.</p><p>Salah‚Äôs consistency is remarkable. He has never scored fewer than 19 goals in a Premier League season for Liverpool.</p><p>With seven in his first nine appearances this season, Salah is on course to maintain that record in the current campaign.</p><p>The former Chelsea man was on target when Liverpool won this fixture 3-2 last season and he looks like excellent value to find the net any time.</p><p>Nottingham Forest have conceded in four of their last five games, so Salah should get plenty of chances to add to his tally.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>‚öΩ <strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Tip Mohamed Salah to find the back of the net at evens with bet365</a></strong> ‚öΩ</p><h2>üì∫ How to watch Liverpool vs Nottingham Forest</h2><ul><li><strong>Location: </strong>Anfield, Liverpool, England</li><li><strong>Date and time: </strong>Sunday 29 October 2023, 2.00pm</li><li><strong>How to watch: </strong>Not being shown live in the UK.</li></ul><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">About the author</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/04/IMG_20221224_103121-3-1.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Greg Lea</p><p>Greg Lea is a freelance football writer from London.
