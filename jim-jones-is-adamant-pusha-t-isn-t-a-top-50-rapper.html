He could rap his ass off, but what has he done?” asked Jones. “Nobody has dressed like him. Nobody wants to be like Pusha T. I don’t remember nothing. And let’s not be evil, but we don’t talk about rap where the n-gga that’s popping the bitches wanna fuck and the n-ggas wanna be like.

Yes. He’s at the top of the barrel when it comes to what he’s done. He’s a billionaire. He’s done some shit for dope boys that people never even thought could be. He’s put himself in rooms that you never could imagine. Alright? And his business acumen is way bigger than his music acumen, at this point.
