However, the entertainer was not that successful in his love life. He divorced more than once and even banned his first wife from their son's life.</p><p class=dh>Robin Williams remains one of the greatest comedians ever in Hollywood. Although he did not have the bad boy demeanor, his uncensored mouth, ability to mimic any character, and striking blue eyes were enough to make him a favorite.</p><p class=dh>At the same time, the celebrity's love life was intriguing. At 35, he had already been married for nearly a decade to Valerie Velardi, with whom he shared a son, Zachary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/7f446ab8f83a392d3fca63ca15b4e987.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>[Left] Robin Williams appears onstage during MTV's Total Request Live at the MTV Times Square Studios on April 27, 2006 in New York City; [Right] Robin Williams with his wife, Marsha Garces and their son, Cody at the premiere of his new movie, "Jumanji."| Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Unfortunately, while celebrating the release and remarkable success of his "Good Morning, Vietnam" film, Williams struggled with an unsettled mind; his first marriage was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://heavy.com/entertainment/2014/08/valerie-velardi-robin-williams-ex-wife-cheating-divorce-death-suicide-dead/>strained</a> due to his infidelity, and they sought to separate.</p><p class=dh>Eventually, the actor and Velardi proceeded with an out-of-court settlement while deciding to share custody of their son. Not long after the separation, the comedian married Marsha Garces in 1989 while she was pregnant with their daughter, Zelda.</p><p class=dh>Garces had been employed as his son's nursemaid by Velardi. So it was not strange to have the press publish that their affair triggered the divorce. However, Velardi <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.bustle.com/p/where-is-marsha-garces-in-2018-robin-williams-second-wife-is-not-part-of-hbos-new-doc-about-him-9690549>confirmed that</a> it started after their separation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/0937b8e7030b2e6943909087ab31fde8.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Robin Williams and wife Valerie Velardi circa 1984 in New York. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>WILLIAMS'S SECOND MARRIAGE TO MARSHA GARCES</strong></p><p class=dh>Garces has a Filipino-Finnish origin, and before working as a nanny, she trained as a painter and served as a waitress.</p><p class=dh>However, her marriage to the actor brought her to the spotlight. The former nanny became her husband's secretary, anchor, and producer. While she served him, she showed genuine concern for his growth.</p><p class=dh>Garces's impact on Williams' life was profound that even his co-stars noticed it. Paw Dawber, who acted alongside the comedian in "Mork and Mindy," <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-a-comics-crisis-of-the-heart-vol-29-no-7/>mentioned</a> that her colleague's wife was dutiful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/de6743fb2ca1d90b921b0b7c8801815a.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Actor Robin Williams and girlfriend Marsha Garces at the "Memories of Me" Premiere Party on September 22, 1988 at the Tavern on the Green in New York City. | Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Dawber used other unique adjectives in portraying Garces's impressive work ethic, and Mark Johnson, producer of "Good Morning, Vietnam," corroborated these claims.</p><p class=dh>Indeed, Williams' second wife nursed him with her love for an incredible amount of years, which was accepted and reciprocated by the actor. While the two lovebirds could not get enough of each other, Williams and his first wife had a slightly challenging relationship.</p><p class=dh>Although Velardi told the press that their co-parenting game was pleasant, Williams disagreed. The actor acknowledged that the split was difficult, but it ended amicably. However, he revealed there was tension in the family; Velardi was upset that a former nanny usurped her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/f5805e05bdc23ea3c4ec01d4f0867da6.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Robin Williams and his son, Zachary Williams. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Despite the nearly invisible bad blood between them, Zachary enjoyed his parents' love. That was not all; the young man was lucky enough to have a compassionate stepmother who cared for him sincerely, raising him alongside his two half-siblings.</p><p class=dh>Williams's growing family did not deter him from noticing his firstborn. They bonded so well, and he gushed about how bright his mini-me was as a child. The only thing that bothered the actor was that the tension between him and Velardi might affect Zachary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/2f06786b2048f57c474d505682a99c03.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Actor Robin Williams, wife Marsha and daughter Zelda at the "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze" Universal City Premiere on March 17, 1991 at Cineplex Odeon Universal City Cinemas in Universal City, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Sadly, Velardi was also worried about her son.

Velardi's absence did not affect Garces or Williams' treatment of her son.</p><p class=dh>Instead, the family became close, and a bond was created between Zachary and his siblings, Zelda and Cody Alan. The trio had an invaluable connection with their father until he died in 2014. Williams was also proud of his kids and often praised them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/597c05e51e920b690a905e6187d40c13.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Robin Williams, his wife, Marsha Garces, and his daughter. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>WILLIAMS AND GARCES' SHOCKING SPLIT</strong></p><p class=dh>This was one of the most shocking separations in the history of Hollywood.
