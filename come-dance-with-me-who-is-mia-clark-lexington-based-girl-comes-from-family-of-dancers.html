We have seen a lot of dance shows over the years. From ‘<a title="So You Think You Can Dance" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">So You Think You Can Dance</a>’ to ‘<a title="Dancing with the Stars" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dancing with the Stars</a>’, these dance shows have always managed to captivate people’s hearts because of the contestants and their extraordinary dance moves. However, the upcoming CBS show promises to give viewers something new to watch out for.</p><p>The series will see 12 young and <a title="talented dancers" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">talented dancers</a> setting the stage on fire with their dancing skills. They won’t be alone and will be accompanied by one of their parents who will dance with them in order to win the grand prize of $100,000. Apart from winning the prize, the shoe will also give them a chance to bond with each other and make their relationship even stronger. With <a title="Jenna Dewan" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenna Dewan</a>, Tricia Miranda, and Dexter Mayfield donning the judges’ hats, it’s surely going to be an epic ride.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a title="'Come Dance With Me' on CBS: 5 things to know about unique reality dance competition" href=# rel>'Come Dance With Me' on CBS: 5 things to know about unique reality dance competition</a>&nbsp;</p><p><a title="'Come Dance With Me': Meet the parent-children duos competing on the CBS show" href=# rel>'Come Dance With Me': Meet the parent-children duos competing on the CBS show</a></p><p>Talking about the contestants, Mia, an 11-year-old dancer from Lexington will be entering the show with her mom Crystal to showcase what epic things this mother-daughter duo can do. Let’s get to know them better.</p><h2 class=split>Who is Mia Clark? Meet the 11-year-old dancer from Lexington</h2><p>Born and raised in Lexington, Mia started dancing at the age of 3 and took a liking towards it. It has been 8 years now and for her, dance has been one of the most integral parts of her life. The young dancer has been competing in several dance competitions, including Legacy Dance Competition and Encore DCS. She has won multiple awards and continues to be a force to be reckoned with by being a part of the Southern Strutt Dance company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn’t come as a shock that Mia has been so passionate about dance because she is just carrying forward her family’s legacy. In a recent interview, her mother, Crystal, revealed that two of her brothers are professional dancers and one of them has now become a choreographer.</p><p>Her Instagram feed gives us a glimpse of how much she loves dancing. It also revealed that she was recently crowned Miss Beechwood 6th Grade and uploaded a photo wearing a beautiful tiara on her head.</p><p>Mia’s partner in ‘Come Dance with Me’ will be her mother Crystal, who has been her support system. It was not an easy decision for Crystal to join the show because she deals with “chronic pain” and just took a leap of faith to support her daughter. She added, “Just taking that leap of faith and putting it in God's hands. It has just opened the doors for me to keep on moving.”</p><p>It’ll be interesting to see how Mia and Crystal manage to woo the judges with their dance moves, but one thing is for sure, the mother-daughter will surely give their best to give a tough competition.</p><p>‘Come Dance with Me’ will be premiering exclusively on CBS every Friday at 8 pm EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRom5%2Bism6wwKeanmWnnsGpecyeZLCgn2K2tHnMophmm5yWv6x5y56voqaXqbyvecGaqp6cXZy2s7iMnKamnaNis7O7zGadmqWZocZuu8Vmm5qmk5q%2FtHnCm6pmqpWWuarA2A%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bailei-knight-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bailei Knight - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./walker-hayes-wife-laney-beville-hayes-is-the-force-behind-his-success.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Walker Hayes' Wife Laney Beville Hayes Is the Force behind His Success</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./raising-the-staal-brothers-hard-work-humility-and-family.html>Raising the Staal Brothers: Hard work, humility and family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./about-davido-his-kids-age-family-and-parents.html>About Davido, His Kids, Age, Family and Parents</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aurora-teagarden-mysteries-order-watch-movie-chronologically-by-release-date.html>Aurora Teagarden Mysteries Order, Watch Movie Chronologically, by Release Date</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kimberly-woodruff.html>Kimberly Woodruff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nyjer-morgan-net-worth-pulptastic.html>Nyjer Morgan Net Worth - Pulptastic</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnogBlogy.
