They met and got engaged in The Pods, rooms where they could talk but not see each other. After they met face to face for the first time, Gigi and Damian honeymooned with other engaged couples in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, before returning to Atlanta, Georgia, where they lived in an apartment in the same complex as other couples from the show. On the day of their wedding, Giannina and Damian were asked if they took each other to be their husband and wife. Though Giannina said yes, Damian said no, which led Giannina to run away from the altar and into the street, where she ripped her dress. Before the night ended, Giannina returned to the chapel, where she told Damian that their relationship is over.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/patrick-mahomes-kansas-city-chiefs.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg><p>However, by the Love Is Blind season 1 reunion, Giannina and Damian seemed to be back together and though they weren’t engaged again, they were dating and taking it slow. “Where we are now, it’s so right for us where we can just date. He has his own place. I have my own place,” Giannina said&nbsp; “We’re getting to know each other at our own pace. And it’s so refreshing. It hurt so much, but it’s all about what can I do with that and what can I do with that.”</p><p>Damian revealed at the reunion that he said “I don’t” at the altar because he thought that Giannina would want to date outside the show. “It was definitely a strong love from the beginning. We pushed through a lot of challenges, as did everyone here,” he said at the time. “But I wanted it everyday ever since I told her I loved her in The Pods. It turned into our love story, but she was in and out of it so much.”</p><p>He continued, “Getting to the day of the wedding, me and her had talked and I said, ‘No matter what happens. We’ll leave this together.’ And she said, ‘Yeah, we do.’ And so when she said ‘I do’ and I didn’t, I didn’t expect that. I thought she was going to be the one to say ‘I don’t and I was going to be the one to say, ‘OK. Well I don’t either. I’ll walk away with you.'”</p><p>So that’s a recap on Giannina and Damian’s relationship. But are Giannina and Damian still together after Love Is Blind? Here’s what happened to their relationship on Love Is Blind: After the Altar and whether they’re still together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Love-Is-Blind-Damian-Gigi.jpg><h2>Are Giannina and Damian still together after Love Is Blind 2021?</h2><p>So…are Giannina and Damian still together after <a href=# rel=noopener>Love Is Blind</a>? Well, at the start of After the Altar, they are. In the first episode of Love Is Blind: After the Altar, Giannina and Damian reveal that they’re still together after many ups and downs in their relationship. Though they’re still together, Giannina and Damian are not engaged again, and as Damian tells the cast, they’re not in a rush to get married like other couples from the show. Still, that doesn’t mean their past issues are gone.</p><p>The main issue in Damian and Giannina’s relationship is <a href=# rel=noopener>Francesca</a>, a contestant from <a href=# rel=noopener>Too Hot to Handle</a> season 1, who Damian has been photographed holding hands with. Damian is adamant with Giannina that <a href=# rel=noopener>Francesca</a> is a friend, and while she wants to trust him, she (and her mom) are skeptical. Fast forward to the After the Altar finale, a.k.a. an anniversary party for the couples who got married on the show, which Damian invites Francesca to. When Francesca arrives, all hell breaks loose. Damian spends most of the time at the party with Francesca instead of with Giannina. Giannina also notices a change in Damian when Francesca is around. He seems happier with Francesca than he is with Giannina.</p><p>At the end of the finale, Giannina confronts Francesca and asks about her and Damian’s relationship. Francesca tells Giannina that she and Damian are friends. As they talk more, both of them learn that Damian hasn’t been 100 percent honest. Damian joins the conversation, and Francesca confronts Damian for telling her that he and Giannina weren’t officially back together. Francesca then leaves the party, and Giannina and Damian have a fight over how he doesn’t respect her. By the end of the finale, it seems like Gianinna and Damian broke up. So are they still together?</p><p>In an interview with Entertainment Tonight on August 2, Giannina confirmed that she and Damian have split. “I am officially single,” Giannina said. “Me and Damian haven’t been dating for a couple of months now.” She also confirmed to ET that she’s “moved on” from her ex-fiance. “I feel really, really good. I’m definitely at a really good place in my life,” she said.</p><p>She continued, “For the first time in, like, three years I feel like I don’t have to keep some sort of my life private anymore. We were just under wraps about everything. I was still trying to figure out, how does my life look without him in it? It’s been a long time, but I feel really good. I’ve processed it all. I’m such at peace.”</p><p>As for what she took away from their relationship, Giannina told ET,&nbsp; “You definitely learn from all different kinds of love. I definitely learned from that. In a relationship, we were just very different, and I think that’s very clear. There’s nothing wrong with that, opposites really attract, but with us, it’s just I guess the way that we communicated, we didn’t really understand what the other was trying to say. It was constantly like that.”</p><p>While the two had “really great moments,” Giannina told ET that&nbsp;“at the end of the day, we just weren’t as compatible as we should have been after dating for two years.”</p><p>The most recent photo Giannina posted of Damian on her Instagram was in September 2020. The most recent photo Damian posted of him and Giannina was in October 2020. It’s unclear when After the Altar filmed, but for Valentine’s Day 2020, neither Damian nor Giannina included each other in their Valentine’s Day posts. They also haven’t liked any of each other’s recent Instagram posts.</p><p>Though the two both still follow each other on Instagram, so Giannina and Damian could still be cordial. To promote After the Altar, Damian posted the poster for the special on his Instagram and tagged Giannina. (She hasn’t liked the post.) Giannina, for her part, also seemed to shade Damian in an Instagram post of the After the Altar trailer, where she mocked questions about her and Damian’s relationship. “HoW aRe YoU aNd DaMiAn?” @loveisblindnetflix @netflix #loveisblind.” (She also didn’t tag Damian.) As for Francesca and Damian, they also don’t follow each other on Instagram, so it looks like they’re not together either. From the looks of it, the love on Love Is Blind is dead.</p><p>Love Is Blind: After the Altar<span> is available to stream on Netflix.</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/entertainment-newsletter-banner.jpg alt="New Entertainment Newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmK6sMLInqpoaWJnfXF8mGieopmeo7avrYydmKahkaN6tMDIpaNmrJ%2BcsrW0xKtkpaemmnqqv4ybo6KmlGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chita-rivera-biography-wiki-age-family-husband-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chita Rivera Biography, Wiki, Age, Family, Husband, Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./amber-dixon-brenner-bio-a-happy-family-life-with-her-husband-and-children-age-and-movies-details.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Amber Dixon Brenner Bio: A Happy Family Life With Her Husband And Children | Age And Movies Details</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./raising-the-staal-brothers-hard-work-humility-and-family.html>Raising the Staal Brothers: Hard work, humility and family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./about-davido-his-kids-age-family-and-parents.html>About Davido, His Kids, Age, Family and Parents</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aurora-teagarden-mysteries-order-watch-movie-chronologically-by-release-date.html>Aurora Teagarden Mysteries Order, Watch Movie Chronologically, by Release Date</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kimberly-woodruff.html>Kimberly Woodruff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nyjer-morgan-net-worth-pulptastic.html>Nyjer Morgan Net Worth - Pulptastic</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnogBlogy.
