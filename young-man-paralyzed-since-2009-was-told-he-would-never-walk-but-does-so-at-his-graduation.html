Talking about the gruesome experience, he <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2021/08/16/corey-borner-paralyzed-walk-graduation/>shared:</a></p><p class=Fg>“They [the doctors] said there was barely a chance for me to walk because my spinal cord was damaged so badly. But I was ready to walk. I told myself that I would be out of this chair in no time.”</p><p class=Fg>Following his spinal injury, Borner's life came to an unexpected halt. Not only was his sports career over, but he now had to use a wheelchair to move around. While he was initially hard-hit, he decided to embrace this challenge head-on.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>FINDING THE STRENGTH</strong></p><p class=Fg>Borner expressed he began believing in his mind that he would walk again. Sadly, he was surrounded by many people who always told him otherwise. Regardless, the support of his loved ones kept him going.

Such activities helped him gain a better perspective, pushing him to take his first steps.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>A RAY OF HOPE</strong></p><p class=Fg>Borner's life changed when his doctor at the Baylor Scott & White Health Insitute for Rehabilitation told him about an exoskeleton suit, a wearable technology that could help him walk again. Borner <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2021/08/16/corey-borner-paralyzed-walk-graduation/>recalled</a> what his mom had told him:</p><p class=Fg>“My mom was like, ‘Stay strong and keep the faith. Just believe you’ll be able to get in it.'"</p><p class=Fg>On June 8, 2021, Borner wore the exoskeleton suit for the first time, taking his initial steps.
