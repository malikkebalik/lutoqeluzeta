Barraza/WENN.com</p><p>It has been just four years back that the couple Chris Rock and actress Megalyn Echikunwoke began dating. But they have now quit. It has been a few months since the two parted ways. For more details on this, the news follows below.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Chris_Rock_breaks_from_girlfriend_Megalyn_Echikunwoke></span>Chris Rock breaks from girlfriend Megalyn Echikunwoke<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Page Six reports that the couple, <a href=#>Chris Rock</a> and his girlfriend of four years Megalyn Echikunwoke, has split. Several sources have shared this sad news with the media outlet. One of them said that it happened a few months back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Chris4.jpg><p>It was before Chris, 55 had poked fun at Amazon billionaire <a href=#>Jeff Bezos</a>’ divorce during this year’s Oscars. And he had remained quiet about his separation from girlfriend Megalyn.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=More_about_the_breakup_of_Chris></span>More about the breakup of Chris<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Another source close to Chris told that Chris was not yet ready to settle after the painful divorce from Malaak Compton-Rock, his wife of 18 years in 2016.</p><p>In his 2017 interview given to Rolling Stone, Chris was still irritated about the whole affair. He had expressed:</p><p>“Getting divorced, you have to f–king start over. You get to reset. It’s not a breakdown, but something in your life broke down.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Chris2.jpg><p>But he also admitted that he had cheated on his wife Malaak with three women and one of them was a celebrity. He did not name the three women but just said:</p><p>“I was a piece of s–t,”</p><p>But at that time post-divorce when he began dating Megalyn, he praised her thus:</p><p>“She’s got her own dough, it’s amazing.”</p><p>But now, it looks like his views have changed and the couple has split.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Chris_Rock%E2%80%99s_relationship_history></span>Chris Rock’s relationship history<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The comedian Chris met Malaak Compton. She founded StyleWorks and is its executive director. It is a non-profit, full-service organization that provides free services to women who leave welfare and enter the workforce.</p><p>They wed on 23 November 1996. The couple who resided in New Jersey has two daughters. The eldest daughter is Lola Simone and she was born in 2002. And the second is daughter Zahra Savannah who was born in 2004.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Chris1.jpg><p>In December 2014, they separated and filed for divorce which the Court approved in 2016. Chris was addicted to porn and also had cheated on his wife.</p><p>But he <a href=#>was pained by the divorce</a> and the custody battle. He now has joint custody of his daughters. In one comedy standup, he said:</p><p>“I had to pay for a lawyer to divorce me. That’s like hiring a hitman to kill you.”</p><p>“I had to go through a custody fight for my kids. Just to see my kids, man.</p><p>“You don’t want to be a man in family court. You don’t want to be a black man in any court.”</p><p>Furthermore, he had joked:</p><p>“Would I ever get married again? Not if it would cure AIDS.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Short_bio_on_Chris_Rock></span>Short bio on Chris Rock<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>South Carolina-born Chris Rock is a multi-talented personality.
