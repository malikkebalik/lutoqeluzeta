It seems that Ike was portrayed inaccurately as a rapper in the documentary based on Tina Truner’s memoirs. According to the documentary, the late Here and Now singer repeatedly sexually assaulted his second wife Tina.</p><p>Mia, on the other hand, strongly objects to the portrayal and insists that her father never sexually assaulted Tina. She is alleged to have called Tina’s sister Aillene to find out if the incident actually occurred after seeing the series back in the day. She does, however, affirm that it never took place.</p><p>Speaking on the event, she stated,</p><p>The rape was not perpetrated. Though I was obviously not present that evening, I called Tina’s sister Aillene after seeing the film and exclaimed, “What in the world?” After that, she gave Tina a call to reassure me that it never happened.</p><p>Mia, who spent her whole childhood living with her father and stepmother Tina, acknowledged that there was domestic abuse in the family but insisted that her father was not a monster.</p><h2><span id=Ike_Turner8217s_daughter_is_Mia_Turner>Ike Turner’s daughter is Mia Turner.</span></h2><p>As previously mentioned, Mia is the daughter of Margaret Ann Thomas and Ike Turner. In January 1969, she was born in the United States. She will be 54 years old in 2023.</p><p>Mia was raised primarily by her stepmother Tina, despite the fact that she was born into her father’s relationship with Ann. The late singer is said to have lived with Tina at the time and even got married to her.</p><p>In reference to Mia’s parents, Ike and Ann, they tied the knot on April 11, 1981, a few years after she was born. However they were unable to keep their marriage going, and in 1990 they got divorced even thoughing that she got along well with both of her parents.</p><h2><span id=Her_Relationship_With_Tina_Turner_Is_Fantastic>Her Relationship With Tina Turner Is Fantastic</span></h2><p>Even though Tina isn’t her biological mother well with her. She once said that Tina is more of a friend to her than anybody else, having spent most of her early years with her.</p><p>Mia also said that Tina was like a second mother to her and that she greatly respects her. She once stated, “When discussing her relationship with her step-mother Tina,</p><p>I still love and respect Tina a great deal; she was like a second mother to me. We did everything together, me being the daughter mom never had. Since Tina is my other mother, I will always hold a very special place in my heart for her. I would hug her and telrespectedI love you and I miss you,” if I saw her today.</p><h2><span id=Mia_Turner8217s_siblings>Mia Turner’s siblings</span></h2><p>In case you were unaware, Mia is one of Ike’s six children. As a result, Twanna Turner Melby, Ike Turner Jr., Ronnie Turner, Linda Trippeter, and Michael Turner are her five half-siblings. Her father’s numerous partnerships gave birth to all of her siblings, and hug gets along well.</p><p>For the record, Ike, Mia’s father from later on, is a six-time marriage. From 1953 to 1955, he wed Bonnie Mae Wilson. He later wed Lorraine Taylor, from whom he separated in 1979. Similarly, he wed Tina in 1962 and they divorced in 1978. From 1995 till 2001, he was also married to Jeanette Bazzell Turner.</p><p>He was in a relationship with Audrey Madison Turner, whom he married in 2006, until his death in 2007.</p><h2><span id=Mia8217s_father_passed_away_in_2007>Mia’s father passed away in 2007.</span></h2><p>Ike, Mia’s father, is sadly no longer with uton December 12, 2007, he passed away at the age of 76.

In addition to being married to a charming man, she is said to have children from her previous relationship. She has, however, largely avoided drawing attention to herself from her romantic life.</p><p>Unbelievably, she has never discussed her children in public. She does, however, occasionally share pictures of her husband on Instagram. She captioned a stunning picture of herself and her spouse from February 2018 with the words “love of my life.”</p><p>This, then, essentially captures their love and closeness together as a couple.
