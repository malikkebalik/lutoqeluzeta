Her career has been active since 2005.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich D Woods is, as of mid- 2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that D Woods` net worth is as high as $800,000, an amount she has acquired through her successful career in the music industry, but she has also launched Woodgrane Entertainment, which has added further to her net worth.</p><h3>D Woods Net Worth $800,000</h3><p>Although born in Anaheim, she grew up in Springfield, but her family moved to Atlanta, Georgia in her teens. Alongside her sister, <a href=#>Shanell</a> attended the Tri-Cities High School, which is a performing and visual arts school, located in East Point, Georgia. After that, D Woods continued at Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, where she went to dance lessons, and finally she graduated from the New York University`s Tisch School of the Arts, receiving a BFA in musical theatre.</p><p>Following her graduation, Wanita embarked on a career in music; before she became famous, she worked as dancer in videos for several artists, but also appeared in off-Broadway theatres, slowly building her career. She was chosen to feature in videos for such artists as <a href=#>Jay-Z</a>, Lloyd, <a href=#>Bow Wow</a>, <a href=#>Snoop Dogg</a>, Avant, and many others, all of which certainly added to her net worth.</p><p>As early as 2005, she became a part of Danity Kane, when she auditioned for the MTV reality television program “Making the Band 3Sean “Diddy” Combs”, and soon enough with other members<a href=#> Aubrey O’Day</a>, <a href=#>Shannon Bex</a>, <a href=#>Dawn Richard</a> and <a href=#>Aundrea Fimbres</a> formed Danity Kane. The same year, the group signed a contract with Bad Boy Records.</p><p>In 2006, the band`s first album was released, entitled “Danity Kane”, and immediately topped the US Billboard 200 chart, and US R&B chart as well as achieving platinum status, which only increased D Woods` net worth. Their second album came out in March 2008, entitled “Welcome to the Dollhouse”, which repeated the success of its predecessor, topping the charts in the USA and it achieved gold status, increasing further her net worth. Seven months later, D Woods was no longer a part of Danity Kane, as after several arguments with Combs, she left and started a solo career, founding Woodgrane Entertainment, through which she has released her own material.</p><p>So far, she has released three mixtapes – “Independence Day, Volume 1” (2009), “Independence Day, Volume 2” (2010), and “Lady In The Street” (2011), and two already mentioned mixtapes, all of which certainly increased her net worth, but also her popularity.</p><p>Regarding her personal life, little is known about her in the media, however, she is quite active on popular social networks, including Facebook and Twitter, on which she has great amount of followers.</p><p>According to sources, she is currently single, but previously was in a relationship with American football player <a href=#>Vernon Davis</a>.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table class=interesting_facts readability=2.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>She was discovered on ABC/MTV reality show Making the Band, founded by Diddy.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>Is one of the five members of the all-girl R&B/Rap group known as "Danity Kane".</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><h3 class=toggle-head>Actress <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actress readability=7><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>We Are Family</td><td>2017</td><td>post-production</td><td>Broweena (as Wanita 'D.
