Not bad but not a red carpet look IMO. I also thougth Haley Erin’s was a miss. Wrong footwear and bag for the dress.</p><p>I’m in the minority about JMW dress as I thought it was too revealing. She has an amazing figure. I just didnt need to see so much of it.

But the print and the fit were just wrong for AN. They swallowed her alive. I’m sure it may have gotten people’s attention butt not necessarily in a good way.</p><p>I don’t know. Maybe she just figured she wasn’t up for an award—and let’s face it, most of the attendees aren’t up for an award—and thought a pant suit might be more comfortable. But I think she could have been comfortable and looked better than that simultaneously.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>I agree, I like pants suits too. Melody Thomas Scott, looked great. But yeah, it was something about the fit, the pattern.

If they’d just done a nude colored dress with all the black embroidery over it, I probably still wouldn’t have liked it that much, but with the visible black panty, it just looked like someone wandering around a red carpet in not particularly attractive lingerie.</p><p>From what I’ve been able to find I loved JMWs and Krista Allen’s dresses, as for KAs hair it was just too flat and straight. I liked Michelle Staffords shear lacy look and Courtney Hope looked pretty good too. As for Annika Noelles pantsuit <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/face_vomiting.png title=:face_vomiting: alt=:face_vomiting: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>she’s finally started looking good on the show and she wears that to the Emmys??? As for Heather Tom wearing the same dress from the Eric party was actually a bit funny considering Jennifer Gareis wore a green version of her blue Emmy dress from last year to the Eric party.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvRnptmm5GnvabAjKWmqKOjYrOwvoydmLKsmaKybrHMprBocGJlfneDnqmYoJ1tZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bayan-shafe-shekaru-ba-a-ji-duriyarta-ba-jaruma-kubura-dako-ta-bayyana-cikin-wani-yanayi-a-wani-hot.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bayan shafe shekaru ba a ji duriyarta ba, jaruma Kubura Dako ta bayyana cikin wani yanayi a wani hot</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pierre-martin-sagna.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pierre Martin Sagna</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./raising-the-staal-brothers-hard-work-humility-and-family.html>Raising the Staal Brothers: Hard work, humility and family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./about-davido-his-kids-age-family-and-parents.html>About Davido, His Kids, Age, Family and Parents</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aurora-teagarden-mysteries-order-watch-movie-chronologically-by-release-date.html>Aurora Teagarden Mysteries Order, Watch Movie Chronologically, by Release Date</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kimberly-woodruff.html>Kimberly Woodruff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nyjer-morgan-net-worth-pulptastic.html>Nyjer Morgan Net Worth - Pulptastic</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnogBlogy.
