[…] For example, I don’t send addresses, I just send coordinates. I can just look at the numbers and know where it is, based on the equator.”</p><p>He went on to explain that his preferred method of information exchange even extends to his life as a budding entrepreneur with multiple businesses.</p><p>“Often the numbers also relate to some of my businesses and companies,” Yeat said. “I actually have a few, but people don’t know about them because they’re privately held, and I don’t want to deal with shareholders.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>In another outtake</a> shared by Kurrco, <a href=#>Drake</a>‘s new protégé also reaffirmed his previous claims that he was abducted by aliens as a kid.</p><p>“That was deadass. It was real,” Yeat said. “I won’t go into too much detail because I’m not sure if they want me to talk about this right now. The aliens, I mean. I will say one thing though – they are really tall – and looked almost human.”</p><p>He continued: “I remember everything on the night that it transpired, second for second. I can tell the difference between a dream and reality, and I know I was awake. That’s also my first memory. Everything before that feels fake. Sometimes I think I might not even be from here, because I have dreams about other planets.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/09/drake-previews-new-yeat-collaboration-in-thrill-seeking-nocta-glide-trailer-250x142.jpg alt="Drake Previews New Yeat Collaboration In Thrill-Seeking NOCTA 'Glide' Trailer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p>Drake Previews New Yeat Collaboration In Thrill-Seeking NOCTA 'Glide' Trailer<p class=related-article--meta-information>September 14, 2023</p></a><p>The mysterious rapper took to his Twitter/X page in July, <a class=underline-link href=#>revealing that he allegedly ran into a foreign species as a kid and they supposedly left him with a message</a>.</p><p>“When I was young I seen an alien n they told me what to do,” he cryptically wrote. “Thats all I remember fr.”</p><p>This isn’t the first time Yeat has talked about aliens, whether in his music or on social media.
