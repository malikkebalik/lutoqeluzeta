According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Hailey’s net worth is as high as $3 million, an amount earned through his successful career in the music industry, which started in the early ‘80s. In addition to performing with Jodeci, Cedric has also had a successful solo career, which has improved his wealth.</p><h3>Cedric Hailey Net Worth $3 Million</h3><p>Cedric is the older son born to Cliff and Anita Hailey; his younger brother, Joel “JoJo”, Lamont was born two years later. The two spent their childhood hanging out with Donald “DeVante Swing” De Grate and his brother <a href=#>Dalvin DeGrate</a> – DeGrate’s father was a preacher, and the four boys would often perform gospel music throughout the southeastern United States. They became fond of music from an early age, and Cedric had his professional start under the name Little Cedric and the Hailey Singers, releasing three studio albums “I’m Alright Now” (1983), “Jesus Saves” (1984),\ and “God’s Blessing” in 1985. Jodeci was officially formed in 1983, but until the early ‘90s they couldn’t land a record deal. It was Donald that took matter in his hands, and began to work on promoting ing the group, and later served as its frontman. He was responsible for their signing with Uptown records, as he sent their demo tape to Andre Harrell, and group was signed to the record label, with their career taking off.</p><p>Jodeci`s debut album was released in 1991, under the title “Forever My Lady”, and topped the US R&B charts, achieving triple platinum certification, so increasing Cedric’s net worth by a large margin. The quartet continued quite successfully, as their second album, which came out two years later and entitled “Diary of a Mad Band”, also topped the US R&B charts, and also improved its spot on the US Billboard chart, as it reached No. 3, in contrast of their debut which only managed to reach No. 18, and achieved double platinum status, which only added funds to Cedric`s account.</p><p>Before they separated, Jodeci released their third album, entitled “The Show, the After Party, the Hotel” (1995), which repeated the success of its predecessors, topping the US R&B chart, and reaching No. 2 on the US Billboard chart, so achieving platinum status, and adding a substantial amount to their net worth.</p><p>The four members decided to go separate ways, and Cedric and his brother formed the duo K-Ci & JoJo, releasing five studio albums, before again reuniting with DeGrate brothers. Their debut album came out in 1997, entitled “Love Always”, and it achieved triple platinum status in the US, and landed in the No. 2 on the US R&B chart. The two brothers continued in the same way, releasing “It’s Real” in 1999, which again peaked at No. 2 on the US R&B chart. Also, the album achieved platinum status in the US, which further increased Cedric’s net worth. From the start of the 2000s, their popularity began to fade, and albums “Emotional” (2002) and “My Brother’s Keeper” failed to enter the top 50 on the US Billboard 200 chart, and to reach the top 10 on the US R&B chart, with numbers 18 and 20.</p><p>In 2006, Cedric released his debut solo album, entitled “My Book”, but the album failed to make an impact on the R&B/Hip-Hop scene, as it only reached No. 57 on the US R&B/Hip-Hop chart.</p><p>Then in 2014 Jodeci reformed, and they released their fourth studio album “The Past, The Present, The Future” in 2015, which reached No. 2 on the US R&B chart. It was their first album in 20 years, and the first one not to reach No. 1 on the R&B chart.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Cedric has been married to Sandy since 2008, however, there are no details whether the couple has children or not. Back in the ‘90s he was in a relationship with popular singer <a href=#>Mary J. Blige</a>.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=16.178035470668><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>K-Ci</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$3 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 2, 1969</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Monroe, North Carolina, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Singer</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Joel Hailey</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6676568/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.24615384615385><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cedric-hailey-mn0001050402</a></td></tr><tr readability=23><td>Albums</td><td>Diary of a Mad Band, The Past, The Present, The Future, X, The Show, the After Party, the Hotel, Forever My Lady, Back to the Future: The Very Best of Jodeci, All My Life: Their Greatest Hits, My Brother's Keeper, Emotional, It's Real, My Book (Edited Version), Jesus Saves, I'm Alright Now, God's Blessings, 20th Century Masters - The Millennium Collection: The Best Of Jodeci</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Music Groups</td><td>K-Ci & JoJo, Jodeci, All My Life, Freek'n You, Crazy</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Soul Food</td></tr></table><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjpycnaqZmHqprcilnLJlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chrissy-teigen-s-hottest-red-carpet-looks-photos-hollywood-life.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chrissy Teigens Hottest Red Carpet Looks: Photos Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./carlos-escalera.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Carlos Escalera</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./raising-the-staal-brothers-hard-work-humility-and-family.html>Raising the Staal Brothers: Hard work, humility and family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./about-davido-his-kids-age-family-and-parents.html>About Davido, His Kids, Age, Family and Parents</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aurora-teagarden-mysteries-order-watch-movie-chronologically-by-release-date.html>Aurora Teagarden Mysteries Order, Watch Movie Chronologically, by Release Date</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kimberly-woodruff.html>Kimberly Woodruff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nyjer-morgan-net-worth-pulptastic.html>Nyjer Morgan Net Worth - Pulptastic</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnogBlogy.
