At the time, more than a quarter of the 28 alleged YSL members named in the indictment were without a lawyer.</p><p>“A continuance to the final week in March would protect the speedy trial rights of those who have asserted those rights, while also ensuring that the additional eight defendants have properly prepared appointed counsel,” Willis argued in her since-rejected motion.</p><p></p><p>Prosecutors also revealed during Thursday’s hearing that they plan to call “around 300 witnesses” in the trial, which could last three and a half months. Judge Glanville, however, believes it will take “closer to six to nine months,” according to Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter <a href=# rel=noopener>George Chidi</a>.</p><p>Witnesses have been a focal point in the case thus far. In August, Willis revealed that a document containing the identity of one YSL associate who is cooperating with authorities was somehow leaked.
