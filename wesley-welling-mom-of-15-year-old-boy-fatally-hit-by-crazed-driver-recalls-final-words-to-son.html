Wesley died in front of his sister on the birthday of their mother on Tuesday, April 18.</p><p>Kelly stated that she received the shocking news about Wesley's death from Hannah, her daughter who narrowly escaped from being mowed down by a Toyota Camry in Thousand Oaks. "I get the call from my daughter Hannah. There was an accident and he was unconscious and they were doing CPR and they did CPR the whole way to the hospital," Kelly said. "That is where he passed. By some miracle, my daughter wasn’t standing right next to him because it could have been both of them," she added, reported <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">New York Post</a>.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=#>'Everybody loved them': Shattered parents remember Chattooga teen footballers who died in car crash</a></p><p><a href=#>Jamiere Howard: Driver, 14, livestreams car crash that ends up killing her 8-year-old sister and 2 teens</a></p><h2 class=split>What happened on the day of the crash?</h2><p>On Tuesday, the 15-year-old boy and his sister along with other students of Westlake High School student were waiting for the bus when 24-year-old Austin Eis allegedly hit him with his car intentionally.
