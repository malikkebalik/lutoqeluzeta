However, Sao Paulo’s immediate financial needs meant that strategy was always unlikely to prove successful.</p><p>So Norwich signed off on a permanent transfer that in Brazil has been reported as being worth £11million ($13m) to Sao Paulo, with another £2m in potential add-ons and a 10 per cent sell-on clause inserted in the deal. An initial £6m has been paid to the Brazilian club up front, with the rest due in 12 months.</p><p>If correct, those figures would make Sara the club’s record buy, although Norwich are keen to cast doubt over those reports and that suggestion.</p><p>Either way, his signing does effectively represent the entirety of their summer 2022 transfer budget.</p><p>Sara becomes Norwich’s first Brazilian player. (This assumes we’re discounting 1998-99 <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Chelsea</a> loanee Paul Hughes, whose mother was Brazilian but whose playing career did not take him further south than a season with <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Southampton</a>. Likewise, Edward Laxton, who made 16 appearances from 1920 to 1921 and was, according to the book Canary Citizens, born in Brazil while his engineer father was working there.)</p><p>A work permit in England for Sara would not have been possible under pre-Brexit rules, which restricted the signing of players from outside the European Union. Equally, Brexit means Norwich are unable to repeat <a href=#>their recruitment strategy from German and Spanish second divisions</a> that helped sporting director Stuart Webber transform the squad and deliver Championship titles in 2019 and 2021.</p><p>Sara is the fruit of the latest strategy, which includes two new South American scouts — one based in Sao Paulo — and a partnership with Brazilian <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Serie A</a> club Coritiba, which is where Sara went on trial as an 11-year-old before his father decided Sao Paulo, an hour’s flight to the north, were a better option.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The midfielder also arrives with expectation, and on relatively big wages.</p><p>Some inside the club believe he could prove to be the best player in the Championship next season and may even become a bigger hit than their <a href=#>previous South American signing (via a spell in Spain), Argentina international Emi Buendia</a>.</p><p>However, Norwich supporters also know from bitter experience why you only start to judge a player once they have taken to the pitch in your club’s shirt.</p><p>Sao Paulo supporters love their “astronaut”, as Sara has been dubbed. Not that the origins of his nickname would suggest it.</p><p>The story goes that Sara’s start to his professional career was inauspicious enough for fans to state that if he was a footballer, then they were an astronaut. Fortunately, Sara got better. But the nickname stuck.</p><p>Sara is now seen as “the jewel of Sao Paulo”, a player who beat his late physical development and an apparent lack of self-belief to catch the eye in the state’s 2019 Junior Cup, and then as a professional in their 2021 Paulista Championship success — a regional competition akin to Norwich beating every club in East Anglia.</p><p>That success earned him a contract that ran until 2024, and in the time since Sara’s stock has continued to rise. He has now made 70 Serie A appearances for Sao Paulo, scoring nine goals and recording six assists after making his debut as an 18-year-old.</p><p>The midfielder has appeared in the Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana: South America’s equivalent of <a class=ath_autolink href=#>UEFA</a>’s Champions League and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Europa League</a> respectively. Both are crucial tournaments to appear in if a player wants a work permit to come to England.</p><p>So what sort of player are Norwich getting?</p><p>Scouting reports picked out Sara’s high technical level, as well as the quality and power of his left foot.</p><p>He has shown the versatility to play numerous positions. At youth level, he was a defensive midfielder but has mostly featured on the left of a midfield pair, as part of a 4-2-4 or 5-2-3 formation, or on both the left and right of a three in a 4-3-3.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Let’s bring in Sara’s pizza chart, which is driven <a href=#>by smarterscout data</a> to give players ratings from zero to 99 based on either how often they complete a given action compared to others at their position (these include link-up play volume, which measures how good they are contributing to their team’s attacking build-up) or how effective they are (such as how well they progress the ball upfield).</p><p>We have gone for central midfield as Sara’s position. However, it should also be noted a sample size of 727 minutes when deployed in that role is relatively small.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/07/08131254/pizza_gabriel_sara_CM_2021.png alt width=2400 height=2400 sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The above chart shows Sara finds space in the penalty area and supports his strikers (a perfect rating for receptions in the opposition box), but he can also move into the wide areas and <a href=#>half-spaces</a> to receive early passes from deep, and operate as an attacking outlet by carries and dribbles (71/99) or linking up with team-mates (50/99), receiving the ball and connecting play in space with one-touch passes in between the lines.</p><p>Sara is strong in the air (aerial duels quantity: 83/99) too, and does his fair share of defensive duties, as indicated by his defending impact (71/99) and intensity (48/99) ratings.</p><p>A prime example of his aerial abilities came with this goal against 4 de Julho in June last year in Brazil’s equivalent of the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>FA Cup</a>.</p><p>Sara times his run perfectly…</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/07/08180311/export-48-1.png alt width=720 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>…then produces an unstoppable header.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/07/08180358/export-50-1.png alt width=720 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Sara was playing in a midfield pair that night, emphasising the quality of his run from deep, but there is a caveat — visitors 4 de Julho play their football several tiers below Sao Paulo and went on to lose a match that was the equivalent of a League Two side visiting a Premier League one 9-1.</p><p>When Sara gets it right, though, he can be special against anyone.</p><p>This next goal is from a 2-0 Serie A win last November away to Palmeiras, who would win the Copa Libertadores final less than two weeks later and then took Chelsea to extra time in February’s Club World Cup final.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>On this occasion, the Norwich new boy is playing on the right of a midfield three.</p><p>Sara is comfortable picking the ball up in wide areas like this, on either side of the pitch.

It’s not like he is a major star here, even in Sao Paulo, but he had a good season last year and they’ve always liked him. Consistency is the missing thing but he has played some decent games.</p><p>“I would never consider him a box-to-box player but Norwich will have done their homework and see how he can fit into their side. He’s 23, so he has got time to develop and I’m sure Norwich are planning to take his basic tools and improve them.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The intensity and tactical level of Brazilian football can be deemed comparatively low at times by those scouting in the country. Sara can lose possession, but he also takes risks in attack. What he will find an immediate step-up with Norwich compared with playing back home is the work he will be required to do out of possession.</p><p>All of those factors will shape how Smith, his assistant Craig Shakespeare and first-team coach Liam Bramley plan for Sara’s arrival.</p><p>The good news is his past and present coaches only have good things to say about him, from his willingness to work hard and stick to his tactical instructions, to his dedication to the team cause and disciplined approach to his job.</p><p>Norwich’s live scouting will not have been helped by Sara’s injury issues, which has contributed to him completing 90 minutes eight times in his 15 appearances this season.</p><p>Sara had been in regular action until initially damaging his right ankle in a 1-0 loss to Palmeiras on March 11. After a month out, his comeback lasted four matches before a tackle in the above game against Wilstermann tore ligaments in that same ankle.</p><p>He needed surgery and was ruled out until September, but was back running last month and had been pencilled in for an August return to the pitch.</p><p>While some may question his robustness, he is said to be the player at Sao Paulo with the greatest capacity for a swift recovery.</p><p>Sao Paulo were nervous the issue would scupper their hopes of the player sale they needed. Their financial issues had piled pressure on them to arrange at least one $10million (£8.5m) departure. They rejected a $10m bid from <a class=ath_autolink href=#>MLS</a> side FC Dallas in January, hopeful of finding a better deal in the current window.</p><p>Negotiations were lengthy, and hard-going.</p><p>Sporting director Webber happened to be in Curitiba, 400km (250 miles) south west of Sao Paulo, earlier this month to discuss Norwich’s new strategic partnership with local Serie A side Coritiba. It is safe to assume he also made the trip up to Sao Paulo during his stay to work on the deal for Sara.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>In the end, it was Webber who relented, as Sao Paulo made it clear any transfer would need the money to be forthcoming quickly, rather than waiting on whether Norwich win a third Premier League promotion in five years next May.</p><p>This move to <a class=ath_autolink href=#>England</a> will represent success for Sara’s Brazilian representatives, who were dealing with initial interest from <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Barcelona</a> when he first broke through — and ensured that interest was known to the public.</p><p>As for Norwich, they feel they have uncovered something special and that it is due reward for their scouting work in South America. That said, it would be naive to assume clubs of similar stature, as well as bigger ones, were not also aware of Sao Paulo’s better players, Sara included.</p><p>“I know some supporters have complained the fee is a bit low but it’s a competitive market, the pound is relatively strong, and Sara is at the upper age for it being his first time in Europe,” Cotterill says.</p><p>“<a class=ath_autolink href=#>Arsenal</a> have just bought (19-year-old forward) <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Marquinhos</a> from Sao Paulo for £3million, so the fee for Sara does feel on the heavy side, but if he does well, it quickly becomes a bargain.”</p><p>Sara will need to adjust from a city twice the size of even London in terms of population, and fifth-biggest on Earth, to the quiet life in Norfolk. To help with that, Norwich will ensure he has a Portuguese speaker around him in his early days around the club to help him understand his new surroundings and communicate with people inside and outside the club.</p><p>“Living in Sao Paulo, a 24-hour city centre with millions of people, and going to Norwich… yeah, it’s going to be a culture shock,” Cotterill says. “But you have got so many extra benefits living in the UK than you do here. You won’t have to worry about being kidnapped or shot at, for example!</p><p>“When Michael Beale (recently named manager of Championship side <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Queens Park Rangers</a>) was here (on Sao Paulo’s coaching staff in 2017), I interviewed him; and during that time, somebody came out of Sao Paulo’s training centre and was held up at gunpoint.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“For Sara and his family, it’s going to be great.”</p><p>If Norwich and Sara make this move work then, whatever the risks, it will have been worth it.</p><p>(Top photo: Silvio Avila/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57km1oaWhoaXxzfJFrZmlvX2aCcLPAm6minZxiwKK%2BwGalqKqnnrCpedOrmKerlpq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chicago-rapper-sauce-gohan-reportedly-shot-in-the-face-sauce-walka-calls-for-love.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chicago Rapper Sauce Gohan Reportedly Shot In The Face &amp;amp; Sauce Walka Calls For Love</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tristan-gretzky.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tristan Gretzky</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./raising-the-staal-brothers-hard-work-humility-and-family.html>Raising the Staal Brothers: Hard work, humility and family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./about-davido-his-kids-age-family-and-parents.html>About Davido, His Kids, Age, Family and Parents</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aurora-teagarden-mysteries-order-watch-movie-chronologically-by-release-date.html>Aurora Teagarden Mysteries Order, Watch Movie Chronologically, by Release Date</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kimberly-woodruff.html>Kimberly Woodruff</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nyjer-morgan-net-worth-pulptastic.html>Nyjer Morgan Net Worth - Pulptastic</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnogBlogy.
