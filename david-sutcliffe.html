Many times, the decision pays off and is rewarding, but for some, it simply does not work out.</p><p>David was previously married, but after a few years of marriage, they decided to divorce. Since his divorce in 2003, the actor has avoided discussing his personal life as openly as he once did.</p><p>Nonetheless, the actor appears to be content with his single status. He is now in his 50s and still looks as young and attractive as he did when he was younger.</p><p>Though the actor is private about his personal life, his fans are interested in hers. He frequently cracks jokes about his love life. Back in 2012, on the eve of Valentine’s Day, the actor stated that he has been single for the past 9 years.</p><p>The tweet came as a surprise to his fans, as many of us assumed he was in a secret relationship with someone. However, based on his tweet, we can deduce that he was dating someone in the early 2000s following his divorce from his wife.</p><p>But then, in 2005, he became single and hasn’t been with anyone since. Currently, the actor is living his life without regard for the rest of the world. He enjoys displaying his youthful appearance to his fans. It’s no surprise that he’s referred to as a fine wine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/David-Sutcliffe-186x300.jpg><h2>David Sutcliffe’s Previous Relationship With Julie McCullough</h2><p>David married Julie McCullough, his long-term girlfriend, back in 2001.
