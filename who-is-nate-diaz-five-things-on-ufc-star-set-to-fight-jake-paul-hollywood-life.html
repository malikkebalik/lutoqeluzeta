After the brawl, Jake spoke out about Nate’s actions. “Nate Diaz was here acting like a bitch. Everyone wants that fight. He tried to fight people in the hallway. Nate, stop fighting people for free, let’s do it in the ring, okay?” he reportedly said.</p><h2>He’s a father.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nate-diaz-ufc-5-things-ss-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Nate is reportedly the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>father of two daughters</a>.
