He boasts about his fancy cars, his diamond chains, and his love for playfully shooting guns. He also touches on his controversies with other rappers in the industry who he feels are getting more recognition than him. He mentions Kanye West and Lil Wayne and asserts that even though they are widely accepted as two of the best rappers in the game, he deserves more recognition because he has sold 7 million records. Ludacris also features in the song and talks about his wealth, his talent, and his musical superiority. Both rappers encourage their fans to turn up the radio and listen to their music because their hits show that they are back in the game.</p><br><p>One of the interesting facts about this song is that it was one of the most streamed tracks on The Game's album, LAX, in 2008. Another fascinating fact about the song is that the beat was produced by Nottz, who is a renowned producer in the hip-hop industry. On this song, he samples If You Can't Beat 'Em, Join 'Em by Tangerine Dream, and it adds a nice touch to the beat. The song received critical acclaim from many music critics and was regarded as one of the best songs on the album. The music video for the song was launched on MTV Jams, and it got over 3 million views on YouTube. The Game references several other high-profile rappers in the song, including Diddy, Lil Kim, and Jay-Z, showing his influence in the rap industry.</p><br><p>The guitar chords for Ya Heard by The Game are Am, F, and G.</p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>You see that cherry red phantom on them big ass wheels</u><br>The Game draws attention to his cherry red car as a symbol of his success and status.</p><br><p><u>See I be playin' with them cars I'm like a big ass kid</u><br>The Game enjoys playing with his luxury vehicles as a hobby, like a child.</p><br><p><u>Crazy with that cap gun</u><br>The Game has a passion for guns and enjoys playing around with them.</p><br><p><u>So if we play cops and robbers, I'll show you how to pop revolvers</u><br>The Game boasts about knowing how to handle guns and is confident he can win at a game of cops and robbers.</p><br><p><u>Fitted cap too big so it covers my eyes</u><br>The Game wears a cap that is too big and covers his eyes, a fashion statement commonly seen in hip-hop culture.</p><br><p><u>That Lambo that ain't shit just a public disguise</u><br>The Game claims that his Lamborghini is just a public disguise to attract attention.</p><br><p><u>And that top model chick she for that diamond lane</u><br>The Game attracts beautiful women who are interested in his luxurious lifestyle.</p><br><p><u>And I be driving all crazy cause my diamond chain is bright (bright bright)</u><br>The Game enjoys showing off his bright diamond chain while driving recklessly and drawing attention to himself.</p><br><p><u>As them Las Vegas lights,It'd be the same in California when I'm ridin' at night</u><br>The Game attracts attention with his flashy lifestyle, whether he is in Las Vegas at night or cruising around in California.</p><br><p><u>And new york I be in mid-town,Up and down broadway havin' meetings all day</u><br>The Game has business dealings and meetings in New York and spends his days on Broadway.</p><br><p><u>Baby my future is bright (bright bright)</u><br>The Game is confident in his future success and wealth.</p><br><p><u>As the bronze take off from anybody,Tyra Banks on my arm and we crash any party</u><br>The Game compares his success to the speed of a bronze medalist and claims to have the ability to show up with Tyra Banks to any party and make a grand entrance.</p><br><p><u>Makin' it rain ain't got shit on me</u><br>The Game boasts about his wealth and claims that he surpasses others' ability to 'make it rain', or throw money in the air.</p><br><p><u>The way I ball the fuckin' owner should come sit on me</u><br>The Game's lavish lifestyle is so impressive that he feels that the owner of any establishment should take a seat and watch him enjoy it.</p><br><p><u>Yeah I'm fresh outta jail you should of knew I was back,Turn up the radio its a wrap.</u><br>The Game has recently been released from jail and is back, instructing his fans to turn up the radio and listen to his music.</p><br><p><u>Don't you hear it that nigga named luda,Slicker than rick the ruler whoop ass like Lex Luger</u><br>Ludacris introduces himself as 'Luda' and compares himself to Rick James and wrestler Lex Luger, bragging about his ability to 'whoop ass'.</p><br><p><u>My money long your shit is shorter than oopaloompas,And I'm super man you'll that ass like Lex Luther</u><br>Ludacris boasts about the length of his wealth, referring to the 'short' Oompa Loompas in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
