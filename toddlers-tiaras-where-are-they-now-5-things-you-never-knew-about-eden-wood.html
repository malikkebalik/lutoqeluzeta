What's more, we will also get to witness some outrageous tactics by borderline deranged pageant parents, who are solely employed to help their daughters shine and win fame amidst the judges. From questionable wardrobe choices and malfunctions, parlor visits, constant grooming, spray tans, and even cakey , stay tuned to watch the reality show as the former pageant divas get together today, recall, relive and reminisce some of the show’s most popular, famous, and spoken-about moments.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p>Let's take a look at the cast of the reality show.</p><p><strong>Eden Wood</strong><br>Eden Wood was and still is a beautiful blonde, who won over the pageant judges with her green eyes and an infectious smile on the show; quite the head-turner, no doubts there! Wood's most memorable and talked about moment on the show was a time when she had a solid breakdown at the World Championship pageant and here's why; she wasn't happy with her hairpiece! Wood's dramatic nature naturally brought in a lot of media attention, so much that she eventually got her own spinoff, called 'Eden's World'! The show followed Wood to New York City, while she pursued her progressive career in acting, singing, and modeling!</p><p>In addition, Wood is also popular for playing the role of Darla, in 'The Little Rascals Save the Day'. She made appearances on 'Nighline', 'The View', 'Good Morning America' and 'The Talk', where she spoke about the controversies in the world of child beauty pageanting.</p><p><strong>Alana "Honey Boo Boo" Thompson&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Honey Boo Boo became popular worldwide after her constant attempts to get some laughs during her time on television, on the reality show 'Toddlers and Tiaras', and also from her own show, 'Here Comes Honey Boo Boo'.&nbsp; Thompson shot to fame for her famous one-liners like, "If you fart 12 to 15 times a day, you can lose a lot of weight", and also, "I just look good 'cuz I wanna look good". Today, Thompson is all grown up, and is just as hilarious as she once was, in her toddler days. She has left her pageant days far behind and has moved on to a lot more meaningful pursuits, like doing well in school, working on being the best aunt she can be, sorting out the family drama between her parents, all whilst running her own business!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/ac567595-3c80-4f94-81f0-ee9ff451271d.jpg><p><strong>MaKenzie Myers</strong></p><p>MaKenzie Myers, then 4, was the star of 'Toddlers and Tiaras', and had also won the title of Supreme Queen.
